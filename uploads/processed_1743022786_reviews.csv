22/03/2025,"Kinda does what it says on the tin. It's an iPhone so if you've had a 13 or later model this will be exactly what you expect. Is it much of an upgrade? Probably not really. I've moved from a 13 to this and it's a bit quicker to do certain things like opening the camera. It's a little better at keeping apps open in the background. The addition of USB-C is handy but not exactly earth shattering. Overall, it is simply an iPhone. If you like them, you'll like this. If you don't, you won't.",Iphone 6,Negative,11.50%,0.11503589898347855

25/03/2025,"I bought 2 iPhones in December for my daughters for Christmas. The first issue was with the pink one , we always turn off our devices and then charge them, the next we were unable to switch it back on. We tried multiple times to re charge , turn it on with no avail. Then we did the exact same thing with my other daughter? (white)phone and the same thing happened a few weeks after that. Absolutely fuming! We sent the pink one back and I still haven? received a refund -being told I?l have to wait until end of Jan and ring them! We had to replace my daughter? pink one as she was without a phone. Now this has happened with the white. So I? Waiting for 2refunds-with a total of nearly ?2k. I regret buying from Amazon as if it was a shop, they would have replaced it and I wouldn? have to wait so long for a refund on such a high priced item, which is a fault of theirs not ours",Iphone 5,Positive,82.69%,0.8269199728965759

28/03/2025,"Lovely dependable and really boring phone. It? an iPhone nothin really groundbreaking to be seen here.Serves just ok, good camera although night photos are poo in comparison to Pixels, great video tho. Camera control button a gimmick I know it? there as it? always in the way when using a case. Used it, we didn? click. Battery is solid. I will stick with it as it plays nicely with other Apple stuff. 60hz no biggie, but always on display should be an option. Apple AI is still not here but it? 2-3 years behind Google anyway so not sure it? worth the wait.",Iphone 5,Positive,66.11%,0.661098837852478
