       "'Bought these for my son and he LOVES them!!! He wears them almost every day! I will definitely be buying him another pair for Christmas.I get lots of compliments for these .I love my Dude\\'s!Love these!!Probably my favoriteArizona colors. Love them!Love the colors and fitVery comfy!These black gravel Wally\\'s are great. They are a heavy canvas , awesome black sole, run true to size. I wear an 11. They can be worn with jeans, shorts, or dress pants.Well made, reasonably priced, comfortable shoes! And unique style!I finally found the shoes I was looking for…comfortable, breathable, lace-up,  & made for my hard-to-fit long & narrow feet. Thanks, ZAPPO’s!\\nJBBought these shoes for walking around the neighborhood and on trails. Wanted a lightweight comfortable shoe with good grip. This shoe was exactly it! Gives me all the support of a boot without having the heavy weight of one.Great fitment, amazing support and worth the purchase. If you are looking fir a comfortable shoe to be outside in look no further.I just tested them on a 50km (round trip) hike and I\\'m very happy with them. \\n\\nWhat I liked:\\n\\n- They\\'re Lightweight\\n- Have good grip\\n- Felt comfortable after 8+ hours of hiking\\n- Aren\\'t waterproof but seal very good. They keep little stones out of the shoe better than my previous hiking shoes (that were waterproof)Its a good option for hiking although the insole could be more ergonomic. Being a new shoe and all it wouldnt prevent blistering so i might have to enhance it by removing the insole and changing it for a new \"performance\" one.The fit was too big. They are about a half size too big.Very comfortable, would buy again!Great looking casual shoe with pants or shortsGreat fit and feel.My husband loves them they run narrow and he has a narrow foot so they fit him great. Wish they made in smaller sizes so women could get also  and come back out with some in different colors or prints again in men and womenGreat shoesCorrect size was too big a half size smaller was ok but both sizes was very narrow.  None of the heeleys come in a medium or wide width. Very disappointing.  Was excited to give these to my son and they are a very narrow shoe.Great shoes, good price, super fast delivery!As much as I love the style and fun of these shoes I fear I’ve grown out of being able to wear shoes without more support. However I will be looking into some inserts.The vans are GREAT! Color and style are perfect! The only disappointment was that  I received them in a generic box. I keep all my shoes in boxes and the box they sent them in I had to throw out.My favorite pair of vans I own!really like the the mid top shoe...These are great looking shoes for my 9 year old. He goes to a Catholic school and they have weekly mass where they need to dress up. These look nice for dress up days but still have the comfort and feel of sneakers, so my son likes them.They felt like old friends the minute I put them on.Great looking shoe.  Fit was perfect for my normal 10.5 foot.  However the lack of arch support, and \"flat\"  feel of the sole won\\'t work well for my intended use as an all day shoe, including long walks.  Great if I had a boat, but I\\'ll return them for something with more substantial feel and support in the sole.Love the look and feel of these. Bold and bright pattern. The fit is pretty standard if you\\'ve worn other Sperry canvas shoes. Nice that they\\'re made with recycled and sustainable materials too.Great shoes had a great price. Easy on easy off. The shoes are very comfortable.Great shoe, comfortable and durable, stylish for casual outing!It was suggested for half sizes to size up to the next whole size. This was spot on for me. I love these right out of the box. Barefoot or with socks, they feel great. I’m a women ‘s 10 1/2 and sized up to an 11. ??Love hey dudes! These are a little different from the more common hey dudes. I thought maybe the cork insoles would not be as comfortable, but they feel practically the same. Material is great and color is as expected. I’m becoming addicted to these shoes!My husband liked the shoes and the fit and comfort and style were good, but he received the same shoe from one of our sons and kept those.  I was forced to pick a reason for return that was inaccurate.  They\\'re nice shoes and moderately priced.Comfortable.  Great product Dude!!!I wear these all the time most comfortable shoe I\\'ve ever hadLike the shoe and the choices of colors. Only thing is the laces are too long. Had to cut them, but otherwise the shoe is nice.Great looking shoes at a great price. Comfortable and fits well. However, there is a big negative. The shoes are not very well constructed. After only a week of casual wear the soles and stitching are already coming apart.This shoe is amazing.  Great fit and looks great.  Very pleased thus far with the purchase.These shoes look excellent; however, it seems that they were poorly manufactured. Two weeks after I\\'ve bought them (and used them only for walking), the sole started breaking off the rest of the shoe, but only on the sides. This might be an unfortunate one time experience, but I would recommend keeping it in mind if you plan to purchase these.Great shoe. I love them Very versatile, comfortable, and Zappos had an awesome price!THe size you need to order is one size larger I wear a size 11 but had to send back for a size 12Comfortable fitThey are great. I love the way they look and feel and they fit perfect.GoodThis is the second pair of these I tried. I wear an 11 in Nikes and Adidas but the Puma 11 was painfully small. I thought the 11.5 would work but no. They hurt my toes in the front and sides too. Puma needs to relabel their sneakers. The ordering and return process is very wasteful of fuel and resources.Very comfortable and a good fit.\\nThe color is not a navy blue, it\\'s lighter than navy.They slip off , size down is too small there needs to be half sizeVery comfortable and lightweight. Easy to put on and off. Love them.Very comfortable and nice looking shoeComfortable and patriotic yet matches so any thingsGreat shoes. Well made and super stylish.I ordered a child\\'s size and got mens size.I really enjoy the shoe it’s a good fit And really comfortable. Matches my style perfect. Nothing bad to say I was gone the other day for like 12 hours walking around my feet didn’t even get hurtPerfectGreat fullI got these for my husband because I thought they looked good and they were on sale. He loved them, they do run a little big though. He went down half a size. Great quality!Product used socially and I receive great commentsBought this shoe from a different retailer originally but when I received, they were about an entire size too big from what I normally wear. That\\'s the only issue. They didn\\'t have a smaller size so I went on Timberland website and ordered the size I needed direct and got a good deal. They are extremely comfortable and I enjoy how they look!The shoe fits great and wear on a day to day basis.I knew they looked good when my brother asked me what kind of boots I was wearing. They feel light and are easy to walk in. Good quality. Exactly what I expect from a pair of tims. Only thing is they run big. I ordered a 9 and it feels like a 10. No big deal though.Cool styling and the fit is good, good arch support unlike Converse.  The color is not a true gray, it has a bit of a blue-green tint.Super comfy, good toe room and durable perfect for working outAwesome quality \\nPerfect fit . \\nHighly recommendedIt\\'s a very classic and comfortable sneakers. I like it\\'s design and the best part about it is that it is high and gives a very unique look. I am really happy with its material and quality too. I would prefer it to others too.Nice and light very comfortable fit true to size good quality and value for money thanks again ADIDASThese initially felt great, but after a few weeks of use, they lost their support. I can only wear them for walking short distances now, anything longer and my feet hurt.I was guided by other reviews in ordering 1/2 size smaller. i normally wear 10.5 or 11 and the 10 fits perfectly.These shoes look really cool. Real sharp eye catcher. Goal all the way. Twas a smidge small so had to return for bigger size. Now all good.I have owned several pairs of Gola sneakers over the years. It is my favorite sneaker brand. ??\\nI love the way they consistently fit. They’re extremely comfortable and last a long time.These are amazing for long walks and short runs… I bought them for style but I didn’t expect them to be great for working out too!Great feeling shoes. Love the look and the comfort! Will come back for more!!This is our second set of Star Wars natives. My son uses them for this “inside” shoes at school. The designs are so fun. Subtle but very cool!Good quality. Fast shipping.It slides to the feet when walking. It is not a good show wear.Good. Not as comfy as older versionWanted to like them, just not that comfortable. There is very little padding around the heel and other rub points. It makes the shoe light, but sacrifices comfort.Excellent.\\n\\nI think there was dip in quality with this brand a year or two ago, but that appears to be rectified; the quality of these is great.\\n\\nThis is a comfortable, easy wearing shoe. Soft and breathable. Recommended if you like cloth sneakers.\\n\\nGave it \"moderate arch support\" instead of none because the liner is good, and removable, but these are flat sneakers.I really like these shoes a lot. I removed the insole since I like minimalist footwear (Inov8, Salming, etc) and my foot really sinks in inside the rubber sole by doing this. If you aren\\'t into that thing the soles work fine, it\\'s just my preference. It does create more room and made the shoe look more stream lined which I think is another plus. My foot measures around 10 3/4\" and the size 11 was perfect.Finally! Larger sizes! Seems like so many of the larger sizes are in athletic shoes or dress shoes. Hard to find everyday good-looking shoes in the larger sizes. My wife wears SeaVees and now I can too. Very comfortable and wear well so far.I wear a pair of Hey Dudes everydayThe best Hey Dudes to dateLike it so much I\\'ve purchase six pairsNice shoe  comfortable easy on easy offLove this.  I\\'m gonna get another pair.I\\'ve had these just under 45 days (as of this review) and the memory foam insole is already separating from the heel. I haven\\'t worn them every day, don\\'t do anything extreme, and they\\'re already coming apart! I have to assume is the memory foam insole, since older model shoes typically lasted for YEARS without insole issues. In fact, the last Skechers I bought was 2 years ago, and only opted to replace because they were starting to get a little raggedy.Most comfortable shoe ever! I have a large wide foot that is hard to fit. True to size, maybe 1/2 size larger at most. The only sneaker I\\'ll wear for the last 6 years.These are very comfortable shoes. The inside with the memory foam that molds to your foot takes some getting used to as it seems to be so soft its a little weird to walk on? If it was a tad firmer it might be better-in my opinion anyway. The toe box is very large. I had ordered in an 11Â½ but sent back for an 11 as the heel was slipping too much when I walked. These are working out great.Use these sneakers only in the gym. The heel is too soft. The stitching by the laces was coming apart when I took them out of the box. Probably will never buy these again.The memory foam on this shoe doesn\\'t go from side to side. My toe kept on falling to the side, and after a week or two, I had a lot of dry/dead skin because of it. I recommend if you like this style, try to find it without the memory foam.Nice shoes but my main concern is the sizing. Definitely go half size down from your daily wear shoes.\\nI’m a 9.5 mens but size 9 were perfect. Hope this review helped.I absolutely love these shoes! At first, they kind of hurt my feet, but it only took a day of breaking them in. I\\'m tempted to buy another pair for sure. One thing though, if you have cats or dogs, these shoes are magnets for fur because of the material. I have dogs so I have to sticky roll them before I go out in them; or keep them in the box they come in.High marks for style, but so little arch support I was limping within a half a week of wearing them for an office job.My son loves the style but hates lacing them up every morning. He says it takes too much time. Otherwise he Loves them and says they are really comfortableThese shoes are everything I wanted them to be! I do have another pair in this style, but in all gray rather than black. The first time I wore these they were a bit tight near the base of my toes, but they were fine every wear since. I find these to be suuuuper comfortable and I can wear them walking around all day. I\\'d say they have minimal arch support, however I have flat feet and I prefer shoes like this. They\\'ve become my new favorite go-to shoes.The fit perfectly. They are comfortable and stylishYOU SEND ME PORT ROYAL COLOR NOT BITTER CHOCOLATE I DIDNT RETURNED EM BECOUSE OF THE PRICE I DIDNT HAVE THAT COLOR ANYWAYFirst time buying a taller Vans shoe and it did not disappoint. True to size. Be careful of sock choice higher up in the ankle. High quality and well designed shoe thanks VansLove these. The mustard color is a fun color and just what I was looking for.Good shoes, very good quality, they are the usual old school.Very comfortable and soft, but still supportive.Fit good. Good quality. Like the style.Love this shoe!  Very stylish and comfortable.The shoe is great. I’m replacing my Ultraboost 20’s and I’d argue those are still quite a bit more comfortable, but these are great for the money. Amazon delivery is a joke. Box was thrown on my sidewalk and in the only pile of snow around.Me likey.These are the most comfortable canvas slip ons I have ever worn!! Canvas slip on shoes are my daily wear shoes as I hate 2 things - laces and socks plus I am vegan so I can only wear cloth shoes. I had been wearing Keds champion canvas slip ons for years till Keds decided to discontinue them. Ever since I have been on a lookout for a replacement pair. Even though these are marked in Men’s sizes, they are pretty unisex (go down 2 sizes). These shoes have a much softer fabric lining compared to Keds and feel very comfortable without socks. I wear them 6 days a week for 10 hour shifts waiting tables and at the end of the day when I slip them off there are no blisters and very little odor even in warm weather. Much better than my Keds which would stink at the end of the day. The backs are also soft and collapsible for those times when you need to mash down the backs to slide them on quickly while rushing out of the door. My only complaints are the back of the shoes get frayed pretty quickly if you wear them every day and the insoles are white which means they get grimy fast (see pics) and the heel cup feels very wet and sweaty despite the holes on the sides which are supposed air out the feet.Surprisingly comfy and great quality. I am a Van fanatic and am always reluctant to try other brands (due to experience). I always get blisters on my heels from shoes other than vans, so I usually steer clear, but these are great! Not as comfy, but no blisters! My heels feel fine.It’s a good shoe for the summer.  I felt that the shoe handled well in warm weather.  I don’t wear socks with these. If you do plan on wearing socks then you might want to size upThe shoe is very comfortable to wear on a summer day without socks.The sole is not too thick like Vans can be.My husband likes these so far.  He wears a 10.5 wide normally and I ordered an 11 and they seem to fit well.  I would definitely size up if your between sizes because his toes was close to the end also.Perfect fit!!Every day use; most comfortable shoes on the planet!A friend recommended these and I couldn\\'t be happier.NiceMy partner tried a pair on in a store, size 11, and that\\'s what I ordered as a gift. When size 11 arrived, it was too small. Will need a 11.5 at least now, which is not in stock on zappos =/Style is great (imo) but the shoes were at least a half size less than marked. (Also - very oddly - the branded shoe box they came in was old and crumpled.)Shoe was stiff and a little tight in the toes.They looked better in the photo than real life.  The toe box is too small and they hurt to wear them.  The box got thrown out, so I can’t return them.Order half size up.GOLA is great but beware of size chart. These shoes are awesome looking and feel great, but I wear a 10.5 US size and the 11\\'s were WAY TOO SMALL so I exchanged them for a size 12. Just a word of warning that Gola\\'s US size chart is way off.They rock the house - \\nThese shoes are super comfortable and in my opinion a good looking shoe. I haven\\'t gotten any additional dates since receiving them a few weeks ago, but one must be patient. The only warning is they feel close to full size smaller than marked.Sweet - \\nI love these shoes, but they are indeed sized smaller than marked. I originally ordered an 11 which is what I normally wear, but returned them for a 12 and they fit fine - a little roomy in the toe but nothing too bad. Have gotten several compliments on them (the black and gray). I\\'m thinking about ordering another pair to have for when these wear out I like the look so much. Once again, Zappos rules.These shoes are awesome.  The most important thing to note is that they are a size smaller than marked. I wear a size 9 normally, but a size 10 for these shoes fits perfect. They\\\\\\'re extremely comfortable and look great. I\\\\\\'m very, very satisfied with my purchase and I have been a loyal Zappos customer for years.  Can\\\\\\'t beat the service!Gola Harriers are pimp-a-licious -\\nNot only are these shoes extremely comfy, I can\\'t stop receiving compliments on the stylish look. These shoes will get the ladies all hot and bothered. Zappos.com guarantees it!!!They running little big with compare with another brandLight weight, wide toe box, and good looking.  Took me a while to find the right shoe and I like this one because it is more for all day walking than running.Shoes fit great, easy to keep clean, and a better work out shoe than expected.Purchased for my son who has bunions, advised best shoe he’s ever worn.These shoes look even better in person. I was very pleased and they fit perfectly.I ordered a 1/2 size up per previous reviews and they were just right.  I love the look and how they feel on my feet.  They are actually heavier than many of my other running/training shoes but are quite comfortable so you don\\'t notice.Very small. Couldn’t even get them on at the size I normally wearI normally wear a size 12, but ended up needing 13 in this shoe. 13 is a tiny bit large, but 12 felt super tight. Very happy now though!Great looking kicks and very comfortable.  They run 1/2 size small.  Had to return and the half size up was perfect.Shorter then ankle socks so socks will show. The arch is great but the shoe is mesh which doesn’t allow for stability in the toe area but it is meant for casual wear and not athletic so it’s like a shoe sandalVery comfortable shoes. Second pair I\\'ve purchased.They fit great and feel great!I liked the style, but they were way too narrow. I wore them for about an hour and they tore up both my pinky toes. I’m a medium width with all other shoes, so I’m not anywhere near a wide width.I’m generally not that into crocs, tevas etc so I was hesitant when I needed to get a water friendly shoe. I’m so pleasantly surprised - these look like vans, are super comfortable, and great price. Thank you !If you\\'re a half size then go with the smaller whole number (8.5 = 8)Women\\'s 10 was too small, and 11 was too big. My heels come off at every step... I love the style so it\\'s really a shame that I had to return it again :-(I really wanted to love these shoes. They are super cute and practical and I love the material, but they just didn\\'t fit my foot right at all. My toes were cramped and my heels were slipping out. I read that since there are no half sizes, you should go down, so I went to a size 7 and I know an 8 would have been too large. I\\'m so bummed, but there is no way that I can make these shoes work for me. If they would have fit my feet, I\\'d love them!Granted I do have very problematic feet, but the excessive toe drop in this shoes caused severe toe pain.  The shoes are not well padded or comfy and the arch felt very hard and uncomfortable. Comfort is very important to me and these shoes hurt even before I stood up.Very comfortable, reliable asics. Would recommend.These are my favorite sneakers!!!! I LOVE THEM! Cute and comfy!Good show so far but easily soiledThey fit fine, just not a great style for me.I returned these shoes since they were advertised as \"original\" Adidas.  The original Adidas were of leather, whereas these were synthetic from the outside, to the inside, to the soles.  I wanted a pair of leather Adidas, so I returned them.  I suppose that for the price, I shouldn\\'t have expected leather.Fit and size OK. I returned them for 2 reasons. 1) the laces took forever to tighten, from bottom to top, and of course to get the shoe off it was the reverse operation, and 2) they were advertised as \"Adidas Originals.  My Adidas from times past were leather, whereas these had a synthetic exterior.The quality had gone way down and the price has gone up. The material is much harder to clean, the shoes are narrow and they start to squeak. I\\'ve been wearing Stan Smiths for years and never had such an issue with quality. I think they need to bring back the old ones .For these I would order a half size largerI ordered a 6 1/2 I needed a 6Fit/size as expected. Like the brown color and moccasin style stitching. Prefer a little more padding in the foot bed though, but think it\\'s a keeper.All my shoes and boots are numb bush ( except my cowboy boots) they don\\'t make those yet. Simple reason, they fit perfectly regardless of style , so why buy anything else.Fit was fine. Problem: not leather so they don\\'t breathe at all and will be hot. I didn\\'t notice that in the description before buying. i don\\'t expect them to last long.Had these shoes for not even about 2 months working in a kitchen and they fell apart. Not comfortable at all and began ripping on the inside and soles of the shoesThis was the best fitting pair of shoes i\\'ve had in a while. lots of support for my high insteps and i\\'m a larger, 6\\'2\" 300lb, active guy. i get at least 10k steps a day at minimum. I lift and twist alot on the daily and these have helped my back issues out a lot. the stabilization of the heel is amazing.Loved the shoe, but it doe NOT have composite toe. As it was shown in description.\\nHad to return cannot use at job site.Perfectos, super livianos no pesan nada \\nLo maximo yo soy fanático de marca ecco pero estos lo maximoGreatWould have preferred the black but out of stock.  Tried the navy blue but just didn\\'t grab meI really like the Puma brand, so I went for the Scend Pro Ultra.  Great fit and comfortable sneaker.I get what all the rage is about. Light. Comfortable. Easy on and off. I’m a 10.5 and 11s fit perfect.Great shoeI bought these for my dad and he loves them. He wears them all of the time. I\\'m going to have to order him another pair so I can wash these.Husband loves themGreat shoes that look goodShoes are extremely light but still hold form, even after wash and wear. This is my second pair and possibly a lifetime shoe for me.Ordered a 13 in the same previously from Famous Footwear. The thirteen was too snug and Famous Footwear didnt have any sizes bigger. I found and ordered a 14 on Zappos. This 14 was like 2 sizes bigger and the design on the top had more of a 3D sheen on top of the design. Like thet were made by 2 different manufactures. I am ordering a 13 from Zappos and will pick from the 13 and 14. Hope the the 13 from Zappos is not small like the one from Famous Footwear. Too bad no one has a 13 1/2.They are great house shoes! I also wear them when out and about very comfortable. Being diabetic they do not cut off circulation to my feet!3 stars for quality issue.  Shoes were a repeat buy for my son.  I have purchased these previously and never experienced an issues with quality.  He recently got these out and wore them for 2-3 weeks and the stitching around front of shoe started pulling loose.  Shoe were not abused, lightly worn. The stitching gave way and the shoe is not wearable due to the tongue not being secured by any other method.  Disappointed in the quality of item. Inspect them closely before wearing.It looked like a good pair of shoes. My don’s school had recently instructed them to have separate indoor and outdoor pairs, to avoid contamination. This was supposed to be indoor pair (which means that he simply wore them in class and didn’t play in them). As can be seen from the pictures the threads have started to come off in less than 2 weeks. Very poor quality and workmanship. I wanted to return but don’t have another pair for my don in the meanwhileThe slip-on feature works great, very comfortable shoe.Very comfortable and very well cushioned.  Lightweight and easy slip in.  I find many Skechers slightly bigger than other shoes, especially slip-ins.  I usually wear 11 1/2 but often get 11 in Skechers and fit finefit perfect, great looking shoeI have several pairs of Hey Dudes. They are great lightweight shoes that tend to run a bit small. I ordered a size larger with these slippers and they were way to big. I exchanged them for my normal size and they fit perfect. Got them on sale for around $22 and I liked them so much I ordered an extra pair!Gift for 98 year old father. He wears them dailyNice structure and comfortable.  Bonus is they came in a size 15!was a friendsThis was a gift for my boyfriend. We both love them. He says they are very comfortable. I like the stylish look. Excellent purchaseNeeded a shoe with better arch support than just a cushion insole.   I already had another model of the Arch Fit Skechers so bought these.  I like the fit, feel, look and especially the sole design on this model.Workout walkingI WEAR THESE STYLISH SHOES MOSTLY FOR CASUAL EVENTS BOTH WITH SHORTS AND CASUAL SLACKS. I HAVE RECEIVED NUMEROUS COMMENTS ON HOW GOOD THE SHOES LOOK. THEY FEEL GREAT EVEN AFTER A LONG DAY OF USE...\\nI THINK I PICKED A REAL WINNER HERE...\\n\\nTHANKS, SKECHERS FOR KEEPING A GREAT STYLE & LOOK, VERY COMFORTABLE AND SUPPORTIVE SNEAKERS ON THE MARKET!!Hey Guys..\\nCouldn\\'t help reading some of the few views elicited so far by these remarkable shoes... And while I normally look for athletic shoes with a \"wide\" toe box I took a chance with these normal width Max Cushion designed shoes... SO GLAD I DID.  While the toe box is amply wide enough to fit many of us that may otherwise want a \"wide\" shoe it is definitely not too wide for the average shoe width user... \\nBottom line here...these shoes are remarkably built for support AND  comfort and look absolutely fantastic...\\n\\nIn all honesty...before buying your next pair of HOKA\\'s, or GDFY you should try these out... they maximise the true \"Value Proposition\" of cost to value!!they weren\\'t slip onsThey are asymmetrical in their design.  One zipper is on the outside of the shoe the other is on the inside of the shoe.  Like a buying boots with one zipper in front and one in back.  Additionally, the little loop-strap, in the back, which would be useful to pull on the boots, is so  short, that I can\\'t get a finger through it. This is a poorly designed shoe, hard to get on and off, even with the asymmetrical zippers. (Now, I shall print my return label, and be done with them)I am very pleased with my Lucas Hi.. I ordered them in tan and they fit a little large.. I usually wear a 14 but measure at a 13.5 and these in 13-3e wide feel about a half size too big but that\\'s fine with me.. if u have flatter/wider feet these feel fine.. love the slip on/off appeal of the zipper on the side.. the laces have a flat wide shape with a slight waxy quality to prevent them from premature wear/untyingFit is snug for me. I ordered a EEE, but my high instep still makes it a little difficult to zip up. I think this will be remedied as I work the shoes in, as they have for the other Lucas shoes I own. The guy who got the asymmetrical shoes should have returned them. My zippers are on the outside of each shoe (see photo 4/19/20). The zippers seem to be strong now, there were some reports that they were not great quality when these shoes first came out two or so years ago.Best casual shoes ever.  I originally ordered a size 14 but reordered a size 13.  The shoes are so comfortable that I\\'m going to reorder another pair.  If you wear a 13 or larger these are the shoes for you.I am a woman struggling for choices in very wide shoes. I bought Propet Lucas Hi in a 9.5 XX (5E). Although I only need the width at the front of my foot, these shoes did not slide around at the heel, which is terrific. I didn\\'t like the Tan Waxy Nubuck color in real life at first -- it was almost orangy -- but it did look good with jeans. They were pretty comfortable, which is saying a lot with my problem feet (bunions, hallux rigidus). (Just FYI, the Lucas did not work for me at all, they are constructed very differently across the front.) The rise in the back was a little stiff. The zipper is nice -- you don\\'t have to adjust the laces. The zipper is on the outside -- opposite from the zipper on the women\\'s Propet Delaney.  I returned them only because of my ambivalence about how often I can wear them in this color.Great design and so comfortable.Awesome design and so comfortable.Looks great ! sized perfectThey are lightweight and comfortable  And they look greatExtremely comfortable, breathable, and super light. I\\' love them!I have been a Sanuk customer for many years Well made great fitting versatile attractive footwear These meet that standardVery comfortable and looks great. No complaints.I bought a pair about a year ago. They fit so good I wanted to order another one. The ones I ordered which are exactly the same are a bit narrower that the one I buoght a while ago. There was no mention of width size on your website or on the tag of my older pair. I figured they would be the same. They are except the width.. They new ones are narrower and just don\\'t fit as good as my older pair. When I put the new shoes and the older ones together bottom to bottom, the new ones are narrower.. Not good!!Not your typical Sanuk yoga shoe sole material.   Very tight,  uncomfortable to wear.   Shoe soles typically yoga mat material which is comfortable and long lasting.   These soles are molded and prone to ; crack and pull away from shoes.I did not like the snug fit or the color of this particular shoe.The fit, style and color were perfect but the sole is so HARD I had to take them off when I was just sitting in them.  So disappointing as I have worn Sauconys for years and the cushioning has always been a plus.Women\\'s Saucony Shadow has not been available.  Instructions were to purchase Men\\'s 1.5 sizes smaller.  I did and they were too small.  I returned and ordered a half size larger (one size smaller in men\\'s) and they fit perfectly.Very cool-looking and comfortable retro shoes. I replaced the cheap polyester laces with 100% cotton ones in white, and they could be straight out of 1978. Not sure I would actually run in them, but as a comfortable lifestyle shoe they are perfect. They look great with wide-legged high waisted jeans.The last pair I had were the Courageous model. They felt well made and with thicker and more durable materials than these. I guess just like with many things these days, the price goes up yet the quality goes down.12 was just too small for me. Should have gone a size up. Good to know with Saucony going forward. Saucony & Asics always fit small.The length was ok but the shoe is too narrow for me and the toe box is really cramped. Not at all what I expected from Birkenstock. I returned them.Unfortunately these did not fit me. I usually wear a size 40 in Birkenstock but the 40 was sold out so I thought I’d try the 39. They were too short. So I need to return but I think these run true to usual Birkenstock sizing. I loved how these looked and the felt comfortable in the footbed but my toes were touching the front. The reason I gave 3 stars for comfort is because the side hits the bottom of my ankle bone and it was uncomfortable. I don’t think a different size would make a difference in this area but if they get the 40 in stock I may try anyway because other than that I think they will be comfortable. These are the narrow width and are perfect for my medium width feet. My husband has these in the beige color in regular width and loves them.These shoes are so comfortable! The first day I wore them, I walked over 5 miles doing a day sight seeing trip. My feet felt great at the end of the day!I love these, but unfortunately they are too big in the heel.  My feet kept coming out of the shoe as I walked.I’m a tall woman with big feet. So I end up buying mens shoes. These are comfy and cute! I was worried when I first put them on because the footbed felt lumpy. But my feet just weren’t used to the support.These shoes are comfortable, look great and fit true to size. I have a brown pair and this rounds out my casual wardrobe.I bought these for my husband for his birthday. He loves them! He loves the look, and says the fit is perfect, with excellent arch support. He says they\\'re the most comfortable shoes he\\'s had in a long time.Very comfortable, great fit and styleGreat show. Slip on ..my 2nd pair.I have two pairs, like them for the comfort and they look good also.I love these shoes, but they don’t fit like my old pair. Too loose in the heels and slipped when I tried walking in them.Very comfortable, nice styling, holds up well so far. I have a high instep, so it can be tough to find low kicks that fit, but these have been great.Love the style, but the quality and comfort are below average.The overall look, style and construction is perfect.   Unfortunately,  had to return because the 11.5 I typically wear in Martin Dingman shoes was too big.  My heel was slipping out even with thick socks.  Would have purchased if they had this shoe in 11.I\\'m very pleased with these shoes - a brand I haven\\'t previously owned.  I have fat feet and generally need a wide but these are fine.  They are made in Brazil, which I\\'ve had good luck with in the past.  I bought a (visually) similar pair by Steve Madden, too.  I\\'m returning those and keeping these Martin Dingman\\'s - they are four times the price but ten times the quality!Etnies Callicut - \\nI just got these shoes for my birthday, and I love them. Always check with a store near you that carries them because the sizes are a little weird. And if you get them and they don\\'t feel like the same size as the one you tried on in the store, it\\'s because a lot of people have probably tried them on too and gradually through that process they have been worn in. It takes about 2-3 days for them to fully wear in, so don\\'t be surprised if they\\'re a little pinchy around the toes when you get them. Also when you get them the dye on the laces is kind of chalky so it will sometimes come off, but it can be wiped right off. I love these shoes so much I think I\\'ll get the same pair the when I outgrow these.Awesome shoe- \\nEtnies are the most awesome shoes. They hold up great except they get scratched up when you casper and the bigger the laces, the less they will scratch.\\nThe front of the shoe will not rip open when you do tricks. AWESOME SHOE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!Fantastic skate shoe - \\nMy son LOVES these shoes. He especially liked that we could choose from so many styles that he could get something different from his friends. They came with extra shoelaces and look very cool with the laces untied/tucked. The shipping was unbelievably fast. WE LOVE ZAPPOS!!Great overall, faddy - \\nEveryone has these shoes now there great, they look fine and are very comfortable.\\nI skate a lot in \\'em and they held up ok.great shoe, great e-store!\\nYour company rocks! We were so pleased with our order and with the speed the items were delivered. We\\'re telling everyone to order from your site!Unbelievably comfortable and stylish enough to rock when you\\'re out and about. I wear a size 9, ordered 9\\'s, kind of tight if you have wide feet. Returned the 9\\'s,exchanged for 10\\'s and they are perfect. Well done Sanuk!!!!I ordered this pair of indoor/outdoor slippers just last week and , much to my surprise,  they arrived 2 days later.  I have been happily wearing them ever since.  The fit is just right, they are very comfortable,  and  the option to step into them with the soft heel as well as slip them over my heel for use outdoors is especially nice.  I also really appreciate the use of sustainably sourced materials which include the hemp/cotton blend upper, wool fleece inner lining, and sugar cane EVA thick sole which seems quite substantial for durability.  I can\\'t say that I know what truly perfect footwear is so I say they are just about perfect.  Couldn\\'t be more satisfied.Like pillows for your feet.I bought them for my husband for a Christmas gift and he loves them.Bought these as sort of an indoor/outdoor slipper. Wear them around the house and maybe walk around the driveway or garage. Working from home these days they are my primary footwear. Super comfortable and warm.I really love these shoes. They feel great and they\\'re awesome looking!!They are very comfortable and fit perfectly! I love my shoes.\\n#sweepstakesTaking a risk, I bought these to play pickle ball in at they paid off. These shoes are so dang comfortable, durable on a gritty pickleball court and help me move freely without worry. I bought two colors in this shoe and probably buy the others here soon once i save enough doe lolGreat looking shoe! Comfortable. I replaced the white laces with tan match laces to complete the  look.I really like this sneakers. I have gotten numerous compliments on it and can match it with almost any color. It\\'s also really comfortable and fits great. What a bargain for the quality! #sweepstakesI have flat feet, and I can’t wear certain brands at all.  My last maddens, like these, are great for the price.  I wouldn’t run in this shoe as the fit in the toe box is tight, but perfect for business casual desk sittingI wear an Adidas size 12 very comfortably. My toe was practically smashed into the toe of the shoe on an equivalent 12 with these shoes.Bought for an island cruise, waterproof, sand, etc. suprised how comfortable they are to walk in. Great beach/boat shoeGreat shoe for going down to the pool or beach.  Run on the larger than my everyday shoes.  Ordered 1 size down from normal shoe size to avoid the shoe slipping on heel.  Fits great.I was hoping to buy this for my husband but he\\'s size 15 hope you guys make bigger sizes.Reef did it again!  Been a fanning purchaser for years but I wear boat shoes/loafers as well throughout the year.  These are awesome and super comfortable.  I love that they can be washed out and dried instantly.  HEYDUDE has got nothing on these. Best casual loafer out there.  Nice color and quality seems great so far.  High recommend.Greatest shoe; comfortable, functional, stylish and easy to keep cleanHave many pairs of frye loafers, so narrow i can get my foot in and i have a narrow footI purchased a pair and when they arrived I could not even fit the top of my foot into the shoe. I exchanged them for a larger size and had the exact same problem. The sizing of these shoes does not match most Frye sizes. If you can try these on in a store before purchasing, I strongly recommend doing so.I have a pretty big medium-sized foot. These shoes fit great. I\\'m a legit 13 and bordering on medium-wide and i have zero complaints. They look good and are well-made. However, that white sole is going to get dirty quickly - so pick your battles. The leather lining is next level - no socks needed.I dunno fellas. I got a big ole foot and this baby was money. I’m a legit 13 and I’m and a bit wide. These are legit.Not sure what everyone is talking about - i have crazy wide feet and these shoes did not disappoint.  They’re pretty, fit well, and look great. Buy them. I’m going to buy a second pair.Don\\'t buy these -- while they are comfortable and look great, the brown lining peels off very easily after wearing it just a few times.The shoe arrived and one of the laces was partially sliced. Annoying, but not a deal breaker. I understand that things happen. \\nHowever, after less than a month of wearing the shoe, the tongue tore off while I was putting the shoe on. I have NEVER had this happen with a shoe before and it looks like there was very minimal attachment of the tongue. VERY disappointing.Wear them a couple of times and they are already falling apart.To me these fit true to size. I’m a 9.5 in vans and am a 9.5 in these. They take awhile to break in but skate well after that.I liked previous editions of this shoe but this year\\'s model has a lower cut heel and is uncomfortable. Where previous versions felt fine this one digs into your ankle. Gave me blisters. Waste of money.Cool shoes on the wider side (flat feet) but around a full size larger.See 1 aboveFit perfectly. I’m normally a 10.5 but the 11 was perfect size. Very comfy for casual wear. Got compliments on the colorway too!Stylish casual shoe. Very comfortable and classic design. Love this shoe with the split tongue. Beautiful shoeNice shoe, I like the split tongue as it adds some breathabilityFits like a glove color is awesome materials are great an is always a big thing that i look for is qualityThis shoes is simply amazing. It\\'s light and comfortable. I\\'m enjoying it. I wanted something darker, but I\\'ve learnt to love this one.Runs VERY small, full size perhaps moreComfortable and so far sturdy shoe. Very non-slip resistant on wet deck stairs. I wear them for work as a Paramedic and they otherwise are working out fine.Felt just like it was made for me, wore it all day the first time, and it did not hurt anywhere.I have 2 pair 10.5 and second pair is 10. They feel just bit wide for me but they have great traction for outdoor activities. I lace them up tight and both sizes work well with the 10.5 I\\'m wearing heavier socks in cooler weather and with the size 10 a much lighter sock. I have several pairs of Merrell shoes. These come in second place to the \"Chameleon\" style.I am a correctional officer, and spend a lot of time on my feet. The shoes offer good support. The shoe bed is not soft, but is supportive. The outside of the shoe is easily clean. I wish it came in a non-slip soleVery disappointed. They feel like wooden Dutch shoes. Stiff, cheap looking and unyielding. Not at all like the older Moab Tacticals I have owned.I\\'m on my feet all day and thought I would give these a try. I love the moab 2 but these are not even comparable. I will go back to the moab 2.I had to return them because they don’t fit the same as my older ones. The tongue of the shoe doesn’t lay right. I had ordered 81/2 and 9. Neither of them fit properly.I bought these 6 months ago as a replacement for my Moab 2 tacticals that I loved and these are not the same. They are not as comfortable and cause discomfort in my hips.Finally a shoe made for AFOs. My son has an AFO in one leg, and it\\'s so hard to find shoes that fit. What I love about these it that they are so deep that you can put extra soles in one foot and still fit the AFO. With all other shoes I need to have the shoe modified to add an outside sole because my son\\'s leg is shorter, but in this case I was able to raise his leg by about 10cm from the inside of the shoe with the included soles. This is a game changer for us.\\n\\nOther Billys tend to break quickly (zipper, sole), hope these ones are better.I am an arthritic, recent amputee who has trouble tying shoes, and changing the shoe on my prosthetic foot was almost impossible! Now I can do it with ease, so have the option to wear different shoes when I want to. No more sore feet from not finding wide enough shoes, either.Shoes are well made, and they work with Allard Toe Off Blue Rocker AFOs. Using the zipper is a little tough unless you can get two hands to the shoe when first putting it on. Hopefully with practice it will be easier.These are the Billy shoes I have been waiting for. I wear specialized carbon fiber AFO braces and even though I have purchased Billy shoes for several years, these are the first shoes that really work with my braces and have enough toe room. I just wish they had more styles in 6e width!I wear a women\\'s size 12 or an EU 44. When switching over to men\\'s sizes, it\\'s a toss up of whether the 10 or 10.5 will fit better. These are an EU 43, though. I knew immediately upon opening that they\\'d be a little snug. The 10.5 says \"43-44\" right on the tongue. They\\'re definitely closer to a 12. I can\\'t fully access the velcro for my SMOs with these, low rise sneakers like Vans are definitely better, but I\\'m undecided on the 10.5. I\\'m getting new ones soon and I\\'ll only be able to make a decision after they\\'re replaced.Fit was good, Sperrys never good arch support, could do a better job with comfortI like the way they fit, love the way they look and can\\'t wait to break them in on our upcoming vacation to Antique.Incredibly Comfortable shoe. The neutral bottom allows for great comfort with no adverse effect on my feet.The fit of the shoe it true to size and very comfortable with the cork insole.  It is a great looking shoe and I get compliments all the time on the way they look.Love the look style and comfort of this shoe \\nVery much like the color accents the comfort fitSeem like they’ll be comfortable but beware they run a full size large.  Not sure what other people were smoking when they said true to size!  I sized down a full size and reordered - Will update once I receive the correct size.  Also note that the lava pattern is very dark - in dim light or at night these shoes appear all black.OluKai makes great sandals. Super comfortable and more arch support than most brands. My plantars fasciitis never flares in these things. They are cut a little big though. I typically wear a 12 or 13, depending on brand, but an 11.5 in this shoe still had ample room for comfort without being too loose or too tight.Fit is just right and they are comfortable.I have two other pairs of Olukai’s and these are not nearly as comfortable, feels like walking in stiff galoshes.\\nThe heal when folded down is uncomfortable with a seam and emblem right under the heal unlike the other Olukai’s.\\nThe design seemed cool in the pics but the blue cameo is a very dark shade when you receive them, more like a black one shade without the cameo.\\nI say the designers missed a chance making something unique and useful but these are not that so they are going back.\\nThey do not make the canvas shoe seen in the pic otherwise I would have both more, time to try a different brand.Ordered a second pair, excellent comfort.I cannot even tell you how freakin amazed I am with this shoe. I had originally bought the white w/ black stripes but really wanted these, too. I am so pleased I got them. I mainly wear them at the gym because I do everything but run, so it makes me laugh to see everyone wearing those horrid running sneakers which I loathe. Note: bit of a warning for fellow lady folk when it comes to the black sneaker with the looser style capris... borders on cankles, and I don\\'t have them, it just creates the illusion of possible canklage. Stick with the baggy pants or tight capris; for some reason they look awesome with those. Looks great with jeans, too. You cannot go wrong here.Love these shoes. The shell toes are super classy and I have been getting non-stop compliments on them. In terms of fit, they run rather big and they are quite flat. I put a gel insole in them to take up space and provide a little shape and they are good to go!Ridiculously high arches and the insole is glued into the shoe so I can\\'t remove them and try my orthotics without damaging the shoe. If you have high arches you will love this shoe, but I have flat feet. It was the worst pain ever. Returned.These shoes are a little stiff at first, but wear in quite well. I use them for swing dancing and they have a good mix of grip and slide on the wooden floor (I don\\'t lose my footing, nor am I stuck to the floor). I really like them (this is my second pair). I typically wear size 7 and got a 6.5.I was a big fan of the original Adidas Sambas when I was growing up in the 80\\'s and 90\\'s. Now, I\\'ve graduated to the Superstar 2, and they are just as comfortable as I remember my old Adidas to be. However, the major difference is that they provide more support (what I was looking for), and as much as I try to get them to look more worn in and dirty they continue to look brand new. While most Adidas are very flat soled (and this is no exception) I wear orthotics, so this is not an issue for me as they create all the arch support I need.The look of the shoe is awesome.  However, the fit was really uncomfortable with a very narrow toe box and very flat support.This my first purchase from Ugg and I\\'m beyond pleased! The shoe fits great, true to size, and keeps my feet warm in this brutal Iowa cold! Will definitely be keeping my eyes out for more shoes like this!My Son\\'s says his shoes give him extra height and they ate very StylishOk so I got these on clearance they were cheap I don\\'t exactly like the look but for the price I decided to give Ugg footwear a shot outside of their boots and let me tell you if you haven\\'t yet you\\'re missing out, I got these and put them on and right away felt like they were gonna hold it down, walked 2 miles to work that morning and worked both jobs (16 hours) and not even a sore toe, heals were fine, I honestly couldn\\'t believe it, new shoes always hurt your feet a few wears but these were top tier out of the box. Highly recommend to anyone in their feet all day.Cool shoes--alas wrong sizeNice comfy shoesThe shoe looks as good or better than it did online in the ads.  The fit and the size are exactly right. The price was 13% off. The shoes arrived within four days of placing the order.  Why would anyone buy shoes online from anyone except Zappos?Color was not what appeared in the picture. There were brown accents in the tongue and outside of the shoe in the photo but the shoe I received had blue and it was not leather. I called and got another shoe sent and it was the same thing, does not look as nice as the online photo.Misleading color/style. The photos for the grey color have brown accents for the patches/tags. The pair I received had GRAY fabric patches. I chose these specifically because of the brown accents. They fit well and still look nice but I was bummed when I realized it.Light and Comfortable!!My husband needed a pair of shoes while we were on vacation. He forgot to pack any extras. These turned out to be lifesavers. Perfect fit, comfortable and stylish enough in the dark color to dress up for dinner out.Sickest shoes hands down, don\\'t change a thing, the trim around towards the bottom makes this shoe the most fashionable new shoe to hit the streets.no arch support and not enough inside sole padding.I was blown away by the presentation of these sneakers upon receiving them. They were so safely packaged, they were simply perfect upon arrival, which has not been my experience with previous brands. The leather on these sneakers was so supple and gorgeous- these are by far, the highest quality sneakers I have owned. They fit snuggly and are incredibly confortable. I\\'ve received so many compliments on these!These are some of the most comfortable sneakers to have on a daily. Clean look with good quality leather. You could easily wear these shoes with anything. The sole of the shoe is the star imo. These are nice and they fit wide which is a plus.Really comfortable and great quality material. Sneakers are easy to clean which is key for white (more like off white) sneakers. For me, they ran a half size big. I usually wear an 11 and 10.5 fit me perfectly. Highly recommend!I really like these,They\\'re super comfortable. They\\'re a really nice material and feel nice to the touch. The inserts make wear comfortable without having to buy any additional shoe inserts. They fit well and arent too narrow like I find with most shoes. They\\'re casual but definitely could be worn with a more business type outfit as well.My husband loves these shoes, he normally wears a dark sneaker and never wears anything light, but he loves these. He instantly fell in love with the soles of these shoes as they were soft and had bounce to them. You can dress them up or wear them with everyday clothes. He is so excited to wear them.Goodtoo bigI did the size calculation based on what this site recommended. I\\'m 11.5 for nike sneakers and it recommended I go with 11.5 for this CK shoe. SIKE! I now have a clown shoe that fits almost 2 sizes too big.Probably one of the best skate shoes I’ve ever had. Downsides are they’re not true to size unless you have a wide foot. I had a pair before these and decided to get a half size down. Got these for a steal too. So get a half size smaller if you don’t have a wide foot.Best skate shoes ever. Tread could be more durable and deeperGreat fit, super comfy shoes!They fit fine but they weren’t the same height or length. Not sure what the deal is but Emerica is a great companyGreat fit, love the material!the shoe just made my foot look big and I did not like how the back lip rubbed I can see it being a blister disaster so I am returning it. I tend to wear no show socks especially in summer. I can\\'t do that with these.Forgot Lakai\\'s come a half size small.It’s a giftGreat shoesGreat shoeFit and size true to fit.  High quality, look great.These are really cute but as another reviewer said, they run big.  Usually I order a 7.5-I went with a 7 and they seem more like an 8, particularly in length.  The width is great for my bunions-I have no uncomfortable pressure points with these shoes but my heel slips a little-some tightening of the shoe strings helps.  I’m still debating if I want to keep them or send them back.Return no logo brand on the white sneaker.The fit was too big length and width. I returned them.These run true to size for sure. I\\'m a 13.5, and the 14s were too long, so I couldn\\'t keep em, but I REALLY wanted to. The sole is amazing. It kinda feels like a vulc, cause of the shape, but it\\'s for sure a cup. It\\'s not a big cupsole either, and it\\'s not too thin. The grip felt seriously amazing, as I stood on my board. I got the Emerica Low-vulcs at the same time (Reynolds), which I\\'m keeping because they are more narrow in the toe and fit me better, but I wanted these Atlantic way more. The sole felt much softer, with more cushion, but same board feel. The upper construction was a little on the lighter side, compared to the Emerica, but was still good. Overall, I give alot of credit to Lakai for this shoe. Hope people are liking it. Maby I\\'ll be a size 14 eventually.These are great shoes for skateboarding.  Very flexible sole, you can bend your feet and toes with these shoes on for maneuverability and feeling with your board.  The plastic heal support on the back broke down on me, feels like bits of plastic inside the materials and now they are super soft back there.It is exactly what was looking forI love Lakai shoes. Comfortable without a break-in period. Durable. Looks great. Can\\'t ask for more in a skate shoe.Bought them for my son, fits great, look good. Great skate shoeToe bed was too narrow for me. Nice looking shoe though!Wow, these shoes were super comfortable!!  Unfortunately, they were very wide and I have narrow feet so I had to return them.  But if I had wide feet these would be awesome.Great fit, great quality, awesome price.Great fitFit great. Look great. Comfortable, would definitely buy more Tom’s shows.It is a wonderful shoe that fit so comfortably. I received many compliments.Love the style and color of the shoe. Puma is a great brand to buyShoes run more narrow than Puma shoes of the same sizeComfortable shoe, first time buying  Hey Dudes, fell like a Cool Dude!!Would buy moreThese were purchased as a Christmas gift and my daughter loves them.I bought these for my grandson and he wears them every day. He loves them.My spouse loves them!I don’t remember Nunn Bush shoes being so comfortable, but glad I found these. They are true to size, well padded, arch placed right on. If I could give them more than a five rating, I would.Great show to wear for work.  Comfortable all day, lightweight, and professional enough looking without any obnoxious colors or logos.Got these shoes for my husband. He loves them and says they are very comfortable and fit perfectly. No need to break them in. The arch support is moderate, so he uses his own insoles like he does for all his shoes. Glad he’s happy.Everything about these shoes was awesome. They were exactly as described and just what my feet needed!The color doesn\\'t represent well on website. These would go with Adidas green colors. The only problem is the shoe is one full size too large, they had to go back. I have 5 other pairs of Adidas Terrex in 14, I wear a 13.5 and they fit perfectly.These shoes rival Nike ACG shoes. The style is fresh and I always catch people staring at my kicks or complimenting them. They\\'re super comfortable yet rugged at the same time. The functionality and look of the drawstring laces sets them apart though. Absolutely an A1 product. Good job adidas! One tiiiime!!I have 5 other pairs of Adidas Terrex in 14. I wear a 13.5 and they fit perfectly. These ran one full size large, had to go back.Lightweight and stylish (both the black and silver designs), this seemed to be more of a running or trail running shoe than an everyday walking or hiking shoe, which is what I was looking for.  So I did not keep these.  The sole however was very flimsy and did not seem like it would last very long with use, and would not be nearly as supportive as a trail running shoe from Salomon such as the Speedcross 6 GTX.  I would recommend comparing this shoe to other choices.  Also, even though this is an Adidas brand, the Adidas styling is subtle and the shoe says Terrex on it. So for those that are looking for brand recognition on your feet, this model may not satisfy you.?I have always found Ecco size 45 shoes to be absolutely perfect for me. This is a surprising exception - too small all around. I will try the 46.The fit is good and the quality is wonderful.An honest review… All my life I’ve admired Puma shoes and their classic wing logo. But they have always run too narrow for my slightly wider feet. When I saw the photo of these Scend Pros on Zappos, they looked a bit wider in the toe box than all other Puma models, so I decided to try them out. I ordered my usual 10.5 size; when they arrived, they were indeed a bit wider than normal Pumas, but due to their still snug fit, I needed to go a half size up. Swapped them accordingly, and they fit great! Also very cushioned and comfortable, and they look great as well. So if you’re on the fence due to Puma narrow shoes, these will probably work for you if you go a half size up.Very comfortable better than far more expensive shoes I now regret buying.Only had these for a couple of days but right out of the box they feel super comfortable. I plan to wear these as a better option for tennis shoes. I wear 10-1/2\" medium and the 10-1/2\" med fit perfectly. These shoes should be great for business casual work shoes and weekend run around shoes. Would recommend them.Very nice looking shoe, unfortunately a little too narrow for my feet.They feel half a number too big, size 10 would be perfectThe most amazing shoes that don\\'t last much. The right shoe looked pretty awful after two hours of wearing. It was hard to believe it after spending all this money...To longThey might be a tad big when you first put them on but, feet swell as you ride and having room for cold weather socks is good too.  So, I say “order your same size”.  Really good shoe otherwise with AMAZING pedal grip.These shoes suckI have a pretty wide foot, went up one size and they fit perfect. Love the grip they provide with the Diety Pedals.The toe box was not deep enough.Received completely different model and size. As I ordered from another country it\\'s difficult to replace it.Very very excellentThe fit was right on. \\nWith the bonus cash from Zappos this was a great deal for leather sneakers for less than $30.Pros: decent width, good board feel, classic style.\\nCons: sole wore out a little quickly, flimsy insoles\\n\\nWhat I like most about these shoes is they are not narrow. I don\\'t have particularly wide feet but it seems like a lot of skate shoes tend to be narrow and these are not… nice and comfy in the toe-box. I ordered my regular size and it was a good fit. For comparison the same size in my last pair of Nike SBs was narrower and 3-4 mm shorter. As for overall comfort, they are comfortable for *skate* shoes… don\\'t expect a cushy sole or a lot of arch support, but they are fine for what they are. The stock insoles are pretty thin and flimsy but livable or easily replaced so no big deal.\\n\\nHow they skated… they took a few days of normal wear and maybe an hour of skating in to feel broken in. After that board feel was good, grip was fine, impact protection was minimal but livable. The only knock I have is they started wearing through the sole under the ball of my front foot about a week sooner than usual for me, hence 4 instead of 5 stars overall. The upper is holding up fine, but I don\\'t do flip tricks so your mileage may vary.\\n\\nOverall these are my second favorite shoes I\\'ve skated (behind a pair of Footprint shoes). I will keep putting shoe goo on the sole to skate them another month or so, and I would buy them again if I caught them on sale.Fit snugHere is a side by side pic of the Emerica Low-vulc, New Balance 379, and Nike Janoski RM 2020 (all new size 14s). The Low-vulcs fit widest with more toe room in the end. NBs felt a hair wider then the Nikes, but same length.muy buenas y bonitas por el precioI buy these for my son. Years ago he needed an all black, completely black, shoe for work. Emerica has removable insoles and he has orthotics. He has been wearing this brand ever since.These shoes are amazing! I have them in black and white; if they start coming out in other colors or finishes (suede) I\\'m in. Super stylish and hold up far better than Cole Haan and other less expensive shoes. They are expensive, but like all AE shoes, if you take care of them, they\\'ll last years.Comfortable dress sneaker that looks good and I would recommendThere is something so grown up about wearing a high quality sneaker vs an athletic sneaker. So much more fashion and sophisticated. Loved my pair so much I actually bought the black one for my good friend as a gift.First timer, unbelievable quality. Perfect fit, insane quality. They call it a sneaker, but you can wear it with anything, from a suit to casual wear, these slip-ons are elite. My favorite pair ever!!!I love them. I have the brown and black ones also. I haven\\'t worn the white ones yet because it\\'s snowing here.My son is 6\\'7\" and works in a hospital.  This is his second pair of SeaCycled Headsail Sneakers.  He loves them because they have just the right amount of cushion for being on his feet all day and they do not have too much of a lift where he might fall off them and twist his ankles.I\\'ve gone through multiple generations of Sperry racing sneakers over the years, including previous generations of the SeaRacer, and the current Harbormaster.  While they\\'ve been good grip and nimble, I\\'ve always found that after a day on the water, my feet soles were aching due to the extremely thin bottoms / lack of support.  These Headsail sneakers seem to have far more sole padding, and I don\\'t even notice my feet when I\\'m walking around the marina after a day on the water.Love these. Love the yellow/green, sharp. Lightweight, nice fitting and they keep my feet cool. Liked them so much I bought a couple spares.Luv the new Sperry\\'s especially at the price pointLightweight and nice look.  Wear these shoes all around.  They are very comfortable.I normally wear size 9.5 in most sneakers so this was the size that I originally ordered.  They were WAY to big.  So I returned those and ordered a size 9.  Still too big!  The 8.5 was the correct size for my foot so I would advise ordering a full size smaller than you normally wear.  The shoes look great and are really well-made and will take a little time to break in but I\\'m happy with my purchase.So happy to have these back again in collection. 90s vibeThese fit at least a half size small. I wear a 12 in just about every shoe out there, but my big toe is right at the end of the toe box. Awful.Very good , recibe in timeI ended up buying two pair of these shoes for my son.  It is hard to find his size in a good quality shoe, but he is very happy with this brand and style.  Thanks to Zappos for their great service!The shoes were a gift for my brother. He usually prefers the DC Brand but was extremely happy with both the style and the comfort of this shoe. This shoe offers more padding and support than other skate shoes.Etnies are the only shoes I can find that hold up to an 18 yr old\\'s rough treatment.  They actually last him a year whereas others don\\'t hold up longer than 2 or 3 months it seems.  Plus they look great!I originally ordered a 7.5 but it felt a half size small so I returned it with no problems at all and received the size 8\\'s before I even returned the 7.5\\'s. The size 8 feels great and comfy.Alas, I am not a skater. I brandish these to show my snowboarding roots. These are good kicks. I went with these over my usual globes because of the budget. If I were a skater I may prefer these over globes because they have great feel. My next choice was fallen shoes but the Etnie\\'s won out. My next pair of shoes though...they\\'re going to be a pair old old man style New Balance hook and loops in black. Those old bastards know what\\'s up in my opinion, going to be great for walking and I miss Velcro shoes!If you like the style of Vans but find them too narrow and lacking support you will love Lakai sneakers. I have them in every color and style. They are the best sneakers out there today!LOVE these shoes!  First pair of Lakais, as I was looking for a comfortable alternative to Vans that I can wear all day and also skate in once in a while.  These look awesome and feel pretty good, too.  A bit snug at first, but they loosened up quickly.  Haven\\'t skated in them yet, and I\\'ve only had them for a few days, so we\\'ll have to see how they hold up, but so far, so good!I get the most compliments on my blue/gum/suede Cambridge’s, but I have 3 pairs in different colors. These feel maybe a 1/4 size large but are otherwise really comfortable. They skate well also.These shoes are dope. I wear them for biking and just walking in general. I wore them while we traveled to japan last year and walked a solid 150miles in them over the course of 2 weeks. Hands down my favorite Lakai shoeLove the look and feel of the shoes. I would have preferred a half-size bigger, but there was too much heel slip so I exchanged for a half-size down which mostly solved that problem. Shoes are comfortable and exactly what I wanted style-wise. Love them and highly recommend.Nice shoesVery comfortable shoeVery comfortableVery comfortable. Great for walking. Definitely recommend. Getting many compliments.These shoes are  so comfortable!  They are a miracle for me.  I used to have constant body aches but wearing these shoes  has made all the difference from the start.  The design is fabulous.  Thank you.I bought these for my husband and he said they’re very comfortable. He wears them with jeans, slacks and even his suits. He would definitely recommend these.Awful fit.  At least 2 sizes too small due to incredibly tight waterproof overlay. Worst shoe ever. Was a final sale - now I know whyJust arrived, I would say they are smaller than the size advertised, socks must be the thin type otherwise won\\'t fit(Darn tough Nova No-Show).As the other review said the size was too small no wonder they won’t let you return. Watch out people read reviews. I should have.11.5 is my size but they felt like a 12I\\'ve worn the shoes four times and each time they felt too tight.  They\\'re hard to slip on because the back is too high at the heel.  They cut into my foot around the opening of the shoe.  I\\'m donating them to a homeless shelter where someone can hopefully use them.Earlier I used to purchase from Online shopping site, however I felt that they are not giving genuine products. I visited Sketches stores in two malls but again I didn\\'t like any shoe there and discount was also lesser. Finally I visited Skechers Official site and I added so many shoes to cart and for 2 days I was only browsing all the shoes. I was liking all the shoes and heavy discounts were there and finally I bought this one and it was just amazing shoes. I feel proud of my decisionSurprisingly comfortable. Almost knit-looking upper looks pretty cool. Easy on and off. Like them.Surprisingly these shoes are super comfortable and stylish. I never thought Sketchers could look this good.  Highly recommend for people that work standing for long periods of time.My first pair of Skechers...love them. Love the style and fit.Very clean and sharp. Just a hair big but not a deal breaker. Nice casual shoes!These shoes were too big.   They felt like men\\'s shoes!Super… subtle… rich and sharp. Love them!perfect fit and great craftmanship.Very high quality.The fit was way too large, about a whole size larger. Which is why I\\'m returning these. The area around my ankles felt too wide and had no structure. The suede seems to be good quality. Margom soles are a nice touch.Good quality.Normally wear a 12 1/2. Ordered the 12 and they fit fine.Fits perfect. Very comfortable.This shoe fits very well. I have narrow feet so the extra lacing provides a more secure fit. The style is sleek and the material is durable. These are my casual work shoes and I love them.These are amazing shoes.  Stylish,  comfortable and eye catching.   Will be getting more of these in the futureI ordered these for my dad and he loved them especially since they were Tommy Hilfiger. Very affordable too.I really like it!!!!!This is a very beautiful pair. Though I feel the shoes are a little bit larger, but still acceptable.These are skate shoes, and very well padded, so the smaller size is to be expected. My feet are pretty narrow, so I can\\'t judge width for the average person, but I\\'d say the padding probably has an effect there too. They\\'re gorgeous, comfortable, and reasonably light. The only complaint I have is that the tongue logo is right under the laces.Husband love them! I love to see him in them too. Great style with good arch support.These shoes really held up well for a teenage boy. The fit was good because he is always complaining that shoes pinch his baby toe. He did not a single complaint about these. I need to get another pair!The pixels felt true to form in size and width. I have only had them for a month but am not disappointed in them. So far they have held up well with everything I have thrown at them.This shoe is does not have leather upper. It\\'s synthetic on nearly all parts and it is way to small for the marked size.This is my first time trying Gola and I\\'m very impressed. The quality is up there with most major name brands in the US. I really loved the look and fit of the sneaker. I find a lot of major brands are lacking in arch support, but these were on point and fit me like a glove. Sizing, I would say sizing is similar to other major athletic brands in the US as well. I\\'m usually a 13 in most athletic brands and the 13 fit me great. I loved the brown tone of these shoes. The only thing I felt was bad about them is the way the tong is designed. It pushed in to the front of my leg/foot/ankle and I\\'m not sure how long that would be comfortable or if it would stretch and break in. I also was looking for a summer sneaker to wear and this region is fairly humid, wet and hot in summer. So for those reasons, I returned them, but I kinda hope they are still available in the fall, because I may repurchase them or something similar, because the color, style and comfort (mostly) was on point.Very stylish kicks.  Extremely narrow.  I have feet that are a bit wide but these were much tighter fit than normal.Sadly, very uncomfortable.  Stiff and had strange sole : uneven.  Bummer.These are surprisingly light for having soles. I love that I can wear them both indoors and outdoors and the insides are soft and cozy. I struggled with sizing though because I\\'m a true 8.5. I have a normal width foot (maybe a tiny bit on the wide side) and wear 9-9.5 in running and hiking shoes. However I wear size 8\\'s in chacos and teva sandals because I don\\'t like the extra bulk and the 9\\'s have too much extra space. Since these are moccasins, I decided to size up. They do slip a little when I walk but my foot is still secure. I have about a thumbs space between my big toe and the front of the shoe when my foot is pushed all the way back. I wish they were a teensy bit smaller but think the 8\\'s would be too snug. They are relaxed fitting and I can still wear socks. I\\'d recommend sizing up if you\\'re between sizes! Unless you are planning on wearing them around town more often or if you want them to fit like socks. The half size up is perfect for at home, running quick errands like taking out the trash, and for car campingI bought a pair for myself last year for daily wear and loved them. I took them camping this year and they worked really well. I bought this last pair for my fianc. He liked them as well, but his feet are larger so I needed to size up. Mine fit fine and I have high arches. I would suggest sizing up, especially if you plan on wearing them in the cold/camping with thicker socks or have larger feet.These are so great!! You can wear ankle socks with them cause they\\'ll slide. They do not run small like some of the comments state and they aren\\'t flimsy like a slipper either. I wore them to an 8 hr work day and they rocked!I love these shoes and have purchased them for all of my family members. They\\'re so easy to slip on and quickly run outside if needed. They\\'re warm as slippers and work great to run errands, too. I bought them as hut trip shoes since they\\'re pretty light and colapse down, but use them for everything!The part that looks like it should be stretchy, right above your arch, is not stretchy.  If you have high arches it digs into your foot.  No good.  Low arch people have fun. High arch people don\\'t buyThe shoe has little support and was not comfortable.Ultra light shoes, nice concept and all but it\\'s impossible to use with no show socks/ or no socks at all. It really hurts the back of my ankle, and for this price, having bubbles/Calluses bad deal. Now I\\'m gonna have to use high socks with it, and the whole reason I bought the shoes is to not use no show socks/ no socks at allIt could be the most comfortable tennis type shoe. I love almost everything, but the back of the shoe where the tag is sown rub the heel and causes irritation.I just got to wear my new ultra range VR3s for the first time today. They are the lightest shoes I have ever worn. Super lightweight, combined with Vans great durability. I find the shoes overall, impressive! Great job Vans!packagesThe animal print UltraRange VR3 is slightly different than the regular UltraRange. This has one less eyelet, and feels even lighter than the original UR. It has a more breathable material and less material near the ankle too. This design is PERFECT to go with any outfit and would make an all black outfit look so good. \\n\\nGot these on sale so I can\\'t complain about the price either !I\\'m a firearms instructor and I have been wearing Vans on the range for years.  This new version fits like a sock and is ventilated.Just a truly beautiful pair of shoes.  They fit like a custom pair, are classy, sporty, sturdy and fun all at the same time. Expensive!!  But gorgeous and I feel lucky to have them and to know about this Spanish craft company.  Hope they last!Decided to exchange the first pair I received due to minor manufacturing flaw. Glad I did. Zappos exchange was quick, free, and painless.\\nThe new pair came in looking pristine! These are top-of-the-line handsome shoes. Can\\'t wait to show them off.Very comfortable fit and magnificent look. There is a teeny amount of \"bleed\" from the dark leather (polish?) onto the white stripe around the sole.\\nAbout 1/8 in. in places, so not visible from eye level, but still a ding for an expensive shoe. I hope they wear as good as they look.Way too small - not even close. Disappointing since they’re such nice looking shoes.I got the black suede with gum sole. After having these for some time now, they have broken in nice. They are a flat footed shoe with fairly low arch support. I have gotten good compliments on the shoe. The suede does wear fast so be careful what you are doing when out in these shoes (suede shoes hate water). These are a comfort shoe for me even though I can run in them. They also came with an extra pair of dark green laces? I didn\\'t put them in. Good shoe, comfortable, looks nice, holding up well.I really love the black on black styling of this shoe and the gum sole is even sweeter. I bought to use as a skate shoe and from what I see and feel this is a solid shoe. I wear a size 12 in most brands 13 in Nike and I have a thin foot (not narrow), so from top tongue to sole this shoe fits perfect. However my toe is right at the tip of the shoe not tight just snug. I will try thin socks to see how that wears. After all I don\\'t want to be swimming in a size 13.They are a nice knock around comfortable shoe. I have a similar pair of Nike shoes that are not nearly as comfortable. It does have moderate arches which are tolerable for those of us with flat feet.IMO best shoe out there.  Stylish, comfortable lots of variations and colors.  And never get a pair that’s cut wrong like most other shoes I use to wear.  Quality control is excellent.  Suede is awesome but takes maintenance and care.  I’ve got dozens of Lakai and sizing is always consistent.  I wear these as daily work shoes where I  never sit and constantly walking, for a skate shoe to have the support and cushion for that and still have the right style is amazing!  I’ve tried some other well known brands and there’s no competition in turns of comfort for long periods of standing and walking.  Lakai are the best.Absolutely love these shoes. The material is very, very high quality. Have had them for over 6 months and they still look and feel as good as new. This was my first time trying Lakai and I am very pleased.Very comfortable , true size. Nice looking.Nice shoe, made in the older style. Very nice!!Happy with it, comfortable and looking goodFantastic fit!!These run small. They fit my narrow feet well, but I had to order a whole size up to fit correctly length-wise.These fit and look great. They are fairly narrow, but that works for me. Similar to Gazelles, but after some defective Adidas shoes, I decided to try these and they are a vast improvement.Super cute. True to size, fun colors. Got them to replace 20 years old Samba indoor soccer shoes I’d been using around town.Usually wear a size 12. Had to return those and size up to a 13. Shoe was too snug around the toes.I ordered US 10 but received UK 10. too big…More comfortable than I\\'d thought they\\'d be~I LOVE these shoes and they are so comfy. Can wear all day to see patients.Everyone was saying the sizing was off but I stuck with my normal shoe size and it fit perfectly imo. \\n\\nOverall really good shoe. Quality is on point! Can’t go wrong with gola shoes tbh.Shoes fit to size . Look great clean and smooth white very happy.They look great! Run larger though and narrow.Runs big.  I have wide feet but the wide was too wide for me.Perfect. Can you please mail out free stickers and stuff?]too narrowOrdered a size up because description when choosing shoe size mentioned sizes run smaller. Shoe is too big now and feels uncomfortable. I recommend just ordering your correct size.Cool looking boot, absolutely no traction, I work in delivery, thought this we be a good boot, it\\'s honestly the worst traction boot you can buyWhen it comes to comfort and performance these are my go to shoes! They\\'re the absolute best, I\\'m on my 3rd pair and will keep purchasing. Very Satisfied!Great show for anything!!!! I will likely buy more pairs before these wear out just in case they get discontinued .Great Shoe !! Absolutely love the fit ! It seems like it\\'s going to be a bit tight,  but, after a few steps in them they open up and hug your foot. Great construction too, with good quality materials. They have a good weight to them without being too heavy which i really like since I\\'m on my feet all day at work walking a minimum of 5 miles a day. They are still comfortable at the end of the day.This shoe is labeled as a leather upper in the description, but the shoe itself is labeled as being synthetic leather.I ordered the gray color, size 9.5 (I’m usually 9.5 or 10 depending on the brand). Even at 9.5 they felt a little big, but doable. I ended up returning them because they were extremely uncomfortable and the upper material was super whack. It felt plastic-y, super stiff, cut into my heel and ankle. I thought it may need a few days to break in but it never happened, not even close. I think this could be a good shoe if better materials were used because the design looks pretty sweet, but unfortunately this one is a dud.This shoe is absolutely wicked looking!!! But it\\'s so narrow, I had to return it.Very comfortable walking shoe.  My feet didn\\'t get sore at all walking miles in these on a recent trip to Portugal and Spain.  I highly recommend them.  Great support and kept my feet warm and dry from the mild rainy weather!Love the style of the Japan S. Not only is it a great retro style, it is well constructed as a basic walking shoe.  The sole is super comfy for those on their feet all day. This is not a running or athletic shoe, but it is definitely a great shoe day to day activities and those on their feet.My husband loves these. There’s some dude logo on the cream is so elegant. They look fabulous on him. Don’t hesitate if you’re on the fats fees are very cool and well-made.Very good quality sneakers and they\\'re very comfortableThese are pretty comfortable. They are true to size. I went with the same size as my Air Maxes and they fit perfect. Going to wear these a lot this summerPerfect and comfyThey fit perfect add a extra 2 inch to your height for the short ppl lol but overall fits greatFelt 1/2 size too small. Very uncomfortable, when walking I could feel the bottom of soul through the padding, felt like the bottom tread was pushing on my feet. Need better padding.My husband said the toe box was too narrow, plus the laces were way too long!\\nThe color was beautiful, but I need to return them.This is the second pair of this particular shoe I purchased because I love the fit and style so naturally I wanted the same shoe in another color.  These are great for summer as you can slip them right on as I think they look better without socks if you\\'re wearing shorts.  I wear them as an everyday sneaker or to casual gatherings.  They would definitely work as a boat shoe or at the country club as well.  They really don\\'t have support so I wouldn\\'t suggest wearing them for physically demanding activities.These are great shoes!  I already have them in another color and they are perfect for summer, especially for the boating crowd!  They combine style with sensibility and go with almost anything.  And they come in size 15!!!Nice shoes just didn\\'t feel great on my footNice shoes but run smallThe sole is thicker and heavier than I expected. Overall, these shoes look good but they\\'re not that comfortable. Narrow, stiff, and heavy is not what I want from a summer sneaker.These are very cute for nightlife and are relatively easy to clean. I do advise against wearing them for longer than 5 hours as they can become uncomfortable and are not great for continuous walking. I am in Vegas right now, and after wearing them for 5+ hours of continuous walking, I am in pain lol. They also make your feet stink, as there’s no way to air out the shoe. I don’t normally have smelly feet, but these make mine stink a bit. They also really have little to no arch support.Shoes fit good, leather is nice qualityLooks great, but really zero support. Not a good shoe choice if you have to walk around a lot. Wore it walking around the city for a few days and my feet were dying from the lack of support.Great shoe! Love them true sizeA little bigger, but feels like you need it to be with the wider arch. I was used to Stan Smiths which are tighter.I bought them to work at the moment, no complaints. Although I almost always have a little problem with the Puma brand regarding the size of the shoes since sometimes they run small, these are fineLacked support and inadequate cushioningNice sneaker great priceThis shoe is very stylish very light very comfortable dress up or dress down shoe. Love it.Very comfortable and wearable for all day use. I purchased as a gift to my husband since he likes wearing Hey Dude\\'s and when he seen Ariat has this similar style he asked for a pair. Now this is go to pair for comfort! Thank you Ariat!Delivered fast, light weight & comfortable, slip on shoe, good quality productVery comfortable love them they are way better than any other shoe I\\'ve wornSuper light without being garbage low density foam. Nice support. I can wear these all day and still feel good unlike the dudes. Shoe is comfortable with or without socks also. I\\'ll be rotating my other dude style shoes out and buying more of this shoe.I purchased the Navy Cord style for my teenage son with autism who won\\'t wear a shoe that isn\\'t easy to put on and very comfortable. He loves these, so they\\'re perfect! I will definitely be purchasing more/similar styles from Reef! They run TTS.A little flat in the arch support and the width was definitely very narrow.Great comfort and arch support however very shallow shoe, barely covers the back of my heel, allowing for the shoe to slip on and off with every step making the shoe not fun to wear.I bought a pair two weeks ago to use as easy on/off indoor shoes to protect my footsies while work is being done in our house.\\nAfter wearing for a period of time without socks, the insoles come up pretty easily when popping them off. And they do get a bit warm after longer periods of wear causing the bottom of the insoles and footbed to be a bit sweaty. Like I said, annoyances.\\nTrue to size in length. Might be wide for some, but fit my wide feet very well.Very lightweight and only moderate support, perfect!Liked the style, but fit was horrible with a painful crease across the top of my foot with every step.  Materials felt cheap also.Osiris shoes seem to be unique skate sneakers. At least, for me, they are. These particular shoes, esp. if you\\'re wearing quality socks with arch support, give you some height and buffering. I have a somewhat wide foot, but just under an E-width, so, I have to look for a happy medium between a D and an E, and Osiris shoes tend to offer that. To top it off, the style may be my favorite of the 3 pairs of Osiris shoes I\\'ve owned over the last 13 years. Give them a try.LoveI got these in the mail today and pawn initial fitting they seem to fit well so I slipped in my arch support and make sure they still fit. I\\'ve been wearing them all day and now at the end of the day my big toe is really starting to get sore which is telling me that they are probably a half size too small. It\\'s very hard to tell that from the get-go. But I do like the shoes, and they are comfortable enough. Much better than Reeboks that I have tried and the Pumas, both of which were flat soles. The Osiris sneakers look awesome and they are worth another try. I will be purchasing a half size larger if I could find them.The sole on the left shoe is coming off less than a month of owning them.These are a really weird color. I liked the style of them but when I got them the gray had really obvious purple/pink undertonesI ordered a size 11 and there is about 3/4\" between the end of my big toe and the tip of the inside of the shoe.  Less would be preferrable, however I also do not like having my toes pushed inward by the sides of the shoe as it tapers to a point, so I guess it will have to do.  Prior to this shoe I wore only Sperry Halyards and Stripers in the summer and usually ordered a 10 1/2\" in that shoe, which was perfect.  Sperry\\'s quality has tanked so I\\'m on the hunt for a replacement.  The prospect of these TOMS being that replacement are promising so far.  I took out the flat TOMS insole and replaced it with a standard thickness Superfeet Flex insole (with arch support!).  I like the quality of construction of the TOMS particularly the stitched-on outer sole.  One quality of the Sperry that I will miss is the ability to wear them sans laces.  Not an option with the TOMS.  I will update this review if these shoes do not live up to my expectations however for now, they are poised to be my go-to summer shoe.Perfect for traveling, very light shoes, comfortable!Great looks.  People keep asking where I got these.Size was exact; material was better than I have come to expect from merchandise made in China; amazingly comfortable!Fantastic Shoe. Fits just right, and has reasonable comfort and stability.The fabric felt rough on my feet.Was skeptical at first, but after a bit of wearing I really like the shoe. It is narrower in the toe box than most sneakers but this isn’t a problem because the material is stretchy and forms to the foot. Definitely a very breathable, light, airy summer shoe. And very comfortable! After a bit you forget they’re on your feet. My only complaint would be the price. I think there are many other choices that are just as good and a lot cheaper than $150.I wear an 8.5 in every other shoe.  I had to get a 9 for the OlakaiGreat shoe, extremely light feeling.  I just required a little more support.These are not for working out. They’re maybe for walking short distances or for fashion only. There is no support and hard on the bottom of your foot.My toes felt squeezed.   Right shoe was very uncomfortable.  I\\'ve worn Olukai\\'s before.  Never had this issue with another brand.Bought one pair at my local surf/snow shop and ended up having to buy another the same week, I like that this looks more like a shoe and doesn\\'t have the super frayed fabric.I used to be a \"Rounder Guy\" ... still love those, but the Shaka Lite has taken the place as the go-to Sandal-Shoe-Slipper Combo ... looks good, comfortable, doesn\\'t warp over time (like the Rounders do) and very importantly, doesn\\'t stink/reek of odor over time/wear ... my only complaint is need more color options!once broken in = good. but like hey dudes the cork insole gets very stinky. better quality than hey dude bit a little. and a hey dude 10 is larger than these which means for me i can wear these sanuks with no socks (normally a nike 10). shoe is not very breathable...Purchased 2 pairs size 10.  Returned and ordered 2 pairs size 10.5.  Received credit for only one of the returned shoes.  Otherwise Sanuks are great.They are very narrow. I have been wearing Etnies Callicut\\'s for years size 12... unfortunately they don not make them anymore. The Marana shoe is nice looking but are way too narrow... too bad because it\\'s a nice style. Sending them back.I ordered 2 different sizes of these trying my best to find one that fit. NOT possible these shoes ~ * RUN SKINNY * ~. early August 2017 THEY HURT they are so skinny.\\nalso don\\'t let the Michelin rubber fool you looked to be the only part of these well constructed. NOT worth the $75. maybe $55 they are THIN & shady construction.\\nAs an ex semi pro BMXer i have worn many ETNIES over the years & they started going down hill in 2000s with FAT THICK tongue designs & not this. SHAME SHAME\\nDont think ETNIES caters to any non tween customers. Guess they think no one has normal width feet. i wouldnt even call mine wide. Returned both & also no longer a customer of ETNIES lost all faith in them.Great looks and fit.these are great shoes, they will last a while skating in them I have been skating these for a week and there is minimal damage compared to vans. They felt slightly smaller then you might want but they are cupsole shoes and there is a good amount of padding, so the slight smallness is just padding not the shoe being small, but I might go up a half size just in case.Was a size too small but ordered the right size and were greatThis is a great and versatile shoe.  I sail a bit and this shoe is perfect for both boating and land-based activities.  I also took it to the gym with me and it worked fine there.\\n\\nThe shoe looks great and it\\'s super light and comfortable.  I like it so much, I plan to get one more pair in a different color soon. \\n\\nPlease note that they run a bit smaller.  I normally wear men\\'s 9.5 and have another Sperry shoe that is 9.5.  However, this one runs smaller to I had to get a 10.Got these for swimming in NY lakes with rocks and mussels and whatnot, and was thinking they would kind of double as all-day shoes. They are great in the water for going up rocks, in and out of the boat etc, and could also be ok for all-day walking or biking.\\n\\nThe problem is once they have been fully submerged they won\\'t be dry again for at least a day. If you were doing like a kayak trip or all day boating where you are in and out of the water you wouldn\\'t really notice, but they start to feel kind of gross if the rest of your body is drying out, and especially the next day when they haven\\'t quite dried out.Excellent traction on slick floors. Attractive with or without socks. Very comfortable.Comfortable out of the box and lightweight. Would buy again.These new boat sneakers (my term) are a great cross between a traditional boat shoe and fishing sneakers. They have great grip on the boat deck, are very comfortable and look great with jeans, shorts, or casual slacks. I really like themShoes are to narrow and tight fitting overallShoe was just about perfect for me.This shoes are beatifull and the size is exact.This sneaker is super comfortable, it looks elegant and its material feels good, it is completely flat, it does not have arch support.  I love Lacoste, this is the 5 pair in 7 years.I really loved this shoe unfortunately it was a little too narrow for my foot. I wanted to get a wider size but it only came in a D. I would recommend this shoe to anyone but it is narrow in the toe so be advised.30th pair of pumasIt\\'s clear that the people who make these do not wear them. The tongue digs into your ankle.I love these shoes except the tongue is stiff as a board and hurts, so returning themThe tongue is rigid and digs into the front of the ankle. I have skinny feet and ankles, so I\\'m not sure who would find this comfortable enough. Design flaw for sure. Otherwise the shoe feels good. Too wide for me but still comfortable except the weird tongue. Also, the bright pink looked more prominent to me in person.Shoes very comfortable,  but they are very loud. Everybody can hear me walk around the office.I like the look and feel...but 2 days later the plastic aglet came off. I pulled on the aglet to tighten the string and it came off.Very lucky light weight, but have a loud squeak inside the shoe when you walk. Brand new and can\\'t wear them due to the annoying sound.The right shoe squeaked every time I took a step. I returned them 10 days ago. Still waiting on confirmation you received them. They were returned with your return label and in the same box they came in. They were dropped at the post office 10 days ago.Will use for business casual work shoesAs stated previously by Jessie I just hoped on here to write a review was going west these shoes for Easter stain on the bottom right next to the white sole is smeared and will run down and not only smear the white sole but also wear thin on the so called leather side.Many compliments on these shoesWhat an amazing looking shoe everywhere I wear the shoe either casually or to work I get compliments. They have held up amazingly for how often I wear and still look like the day I bought them. Definitely money well spent!I really like the design and look of this shoe, but it looked like the rubber got stained from the leather, and generally appeared sloppy where the rubber meets the leather.  It\\'s a shame because the materials are very nice. The toe room is also kind of tight for me. For the price, it should have a nice finish.\\n\\nI\\'d be willing to try again later, but I ended up going with Olukai Le-ahi Li\\'lli\\'sI was incredibly excited to get these Vejas and give them a try...seeing them everywhere in IG and in cities.  I wear a women\\'s 11, since hard to find Vejas in a women\\'s 42 I opted to try the unisex/men\\'s in a 42.  Super cute out of the box but they are VERY stiff and HARD on the insole/inside.  They felt very clunky and not comfy.  I had read took a bit to break them in but on my smaller foot I immediately felt the shoe rubbing my left big toe.  I wear a medium width and do not have wide feet, so opted to send these back.  Think I am sticking to my onitsukus....found these shoes to be incredibly uncomfortable.This is a nice-looking shoe and a few strangers have asked me about them. When they arrive, they are much stiffer than similar-looking shoes. This may have something to do with the closely-spaced and abundant shoelace eyelets, as well as the natural and recycled materials the shoe is made from. But they started to loosen up within two weeks or so. The footbed is more like a sneaker than an athletic shoe. I\\'m using an insole for arch support.tongue too long. digs into ankle. sent them back.Love the look. Clean, classy.Comfortable and good looking.These are great looking shoes but they\\'re intolerably squeaky. I was upstairs when I tried the shoes on, my wife was downstairs and she could hear the shoes squeaking. Our dogs were afraid of these shoes, I\\'m not exaggerating. I\\'m normally a Polo fan but these shoes are not wearable.Great looking shoe but were to wide for me and had to return them.Stylist. Made well true to size. Comfort is moderate. Need to be broken in.If you are on your feet more than six hours at a time snd you want an all around solid comfortable shie, this is it!Hi just got these in the mail yesterday. I was looking for a good alternative to the Common Projects Achilles. Aesthetically these are pretty damn close and 250 dollars less. The stitching and leather are great quality with no apparent cracks after a couple days of wear. Already getting compliments and questions about them. I would say that if I had known better I would have sized down a half size, but I haven\\'t seen any reviews yet. With a large toe box this shoe runs long and narrow and I would equate the sizing to the same you would use when buying a pair of Chuck Taylors. They might fit a little snug at first but the leather will stretch a bit and fit you like a glove eventually. the cushioning on the inside is all leather and a dream to walk in without socks. These are selling out fast, so I will have to wait until the 11 and a half size becomes available. I would normally return a pair that was a half size too big, but I will hold on to these for now. They are just that hot!Fit to sizeBought these for my husband and he loves them! They are surprisingly SUPER light. I barely thought there was anything in the box at first. They\\'re stylish and sporty. They fit true to size, and he says they are comfortable. I think I\\'ll order him a few more colors!Unfortunately this sneaker didn’t work out for us. My son complained that it was very uncomfortable and it felt as if his foot was sliding around inside it, even though he had tightened the laces as much as possible. I would return it, but he wore it for a week in hopes it would become more comfortable with time — which didn’t happen. Need to buy a replacement. This is the first time ever my son has complained about a sneaker.The shoe is light with good arch support. I ordered 1/2 size bigger as suggested. I wore them on our vacation excursions and my feet ached after 1hr. I was disappointed because I really like the style.I only wear these once a day to walk the dogs and they already have holes in the toesI’ve been wearing Jazz 81 for over a year now, red and black both. I work in an extremely busy retail pharmacy and I’m on my feet for no less than 8 hours a day. Lots of steps. This is hard on any shoe I purchase and in 19 years, I’ve tried a lot. I bought these for appearance but they have absolutely become my favorite work shoe for not just look but comfort. Everyone is different, obviously. I just know I’m constantly looking for sales on these both here and their website. I will absolutely be buying more colors! Size is pretty accurate, I go between a 7.5 and 8, these are an 8.Just went for my first long walk in these and they’re okay, but not amazing. Even though I ordered a size up from my normal size, they still feel strangely narrow in the toe, and the tongue has a sort of scratchy edge that rubbed against my skin. They’re nice and lightweight, decent cushioning and arch support. The orange color is more muted, more like brick or rust than the pumpkiny orange in the picture. I’ll keep them and hope they get comfier as I break them in.The upper of the sneaker looks great and the tongue is comfortable on the top of your foot. However, the sole of the sneaker is not the best and sort of stiff with a plastic-y feel.Look great and feel great per my 87 year old husband.  He wasn\\'t keen on white near sole but convinced him they made him look younger and trendy.  Great shoe and like only one strap to adjust!Before my shoes arrived, I was afraid they would be too small.    These shoes fit my wide feet with high instep perfectly (9.5W). Because the open design on top, they have more room than a regular 9.5 slip-on. Shoes are very well built and look good.  First time used Zappos.  I am very impressed with Zappos\\' excellent and speedy  service (one day earlier than expected). I have ordered a jean through Zappos after this order.  Forget about Amazon!The fit is a little tight will need breaking in. A wider width would have been better as I prefer a comfortable fit without having a \"break-in\" period>Think I ordered men’s rather than women’s.Nice looking shoe had to go one width widerThey Look Great but They Definitely didn\\'t Feel Good and we\\'re taken Off My Foot just as Fast and in the Box to be Shipped Back.\\nI give these a Solid ¹One but Definitely couldn\\'t Dance to that Score or Dancing in those Shoes.\\nThere are Better Shoes out there so go Find Them.\\n~)*(~Have had many pairs of the Kingpin, one of my favorite all time shoes.Blue and gum colored bottom looked cool together. Bought them for my husband and he really liked them.The tongue is ridiculously thick. Overall, it seemed like it was the right size, but I didn’t find it to be comfortable.Amazing shoe so far, but I should have gotten half a size down. Still an amazing shoe though!It\\'s super comfortable. I always try to buy DC shoes - they fit my feet AND are comfortable for long walks - and this new pair doesn\\'t disappoint.GreatI love the look of these shoes and they are really comfortable! I like how the white sole is pretty thin. Highly recommend these.I love Sperry canvas shoes / sneakers. Own several pairs of the Striper and 2 recent \"seacycled\" versions, in different colors. Highly breathable, stylish and never out-of-fashion. My preferred style is \"preppy\" but these are not confined in any way to that preference. Quite adaptable. These are not for long walks on bumpy terrain, as little in way of arch support. But, still a timeless classic. Perfect for beach-outings and casual walks.My boyfriend loves these! They are a great summer/spring shoe. The only thing is they do run a little small, but if you do not wear socks, they seem to fit fine. \\nThey are trendy and look so good and I\\'m sure he will be wearing them for the entire summer!Nice looking shoe and felt very high quality.  I really liked them, but the side collar was too big (too much cushion) and it pushed against the ankle.  It hurt after a few minutes.  This is the first sperry shoe that wasn\\'t comfortable out of the box.  The shoe laces were terrible.  No one likes leather laces - especially when the shoe is not leather.  They should be cloth.  Leather laces are hard to tie and never hold.Fit great! I ordered a half size bigger than I needed.These shoes look great and feel great but unfortunately they didn’t last very long for me. I’ve had them for about 7 months. I wear them 1-2 times per week when I have to go into the office. I’m in the office at a desk job for 6-8 hours each day. The soles have worn out and separated in the front.Good looking shoesThese shoes are good for style BUT if you actually SKATE they fall apart faster then a celebrity marriage. Im certain that tapping the money to your feet would be more durable. Only get these for style, nothing else they are seriously just terrible, and before you get your pitchforks out I only skated in these for about an hours before they had a huge hole in the side. I\\'m not even that hardcore I\\'m talking just some ollies and flip trips on flat. If you have avoided smoking because you don\\'t want cancer or heart disease do not get these because they are so terrible I now have both.They fit big feet! My son wears a size 14 and usually gets a double wide shoe. He also has high arches. Thus, it\\'s difficult to find youthful-looking sneakers that fit. These were a wonderful surprise fit given that they don\\'t even come in a wide width.Enjoyed these shoes until they fell apart. I kept feeling something irritating my left heel when I walked after wearing them for a few months. The fabric eventually tore and this was what fell out from the heel counter that had literally disintegrated. Poor quality. Look great but don\\'t count on durability.I got these for my boyfriend and he really likes them. They fit him perfect right out of the box and he was actually really surprised they fit so good. Design is awesome too they are cool and casual but still look nice.The sole started allowing water to start leaking in within a few months of owning the shoe. Disappointed in the quality. The last pair of Etnies lasted years.These are adorable, have good support and are just what I was hoping my son would love. Unfortunately, he didn\\'t love them so we did return them. But...I still like them! He is 16 and I\\'m a physical therapist.I really like these but they are pretty tight/narrow.  length seems good compared to past keens I have had. Since they are knit, I am hoping they stretch.So far so great! Very comfortable and stylish. Go with everything. My other Steve Madden shoes have lasted me years, hoping these will hold up too.Don\\'t know why but they made my feet hurt.Looks sleek, black material can get stained though.Pretty comfortable sneaker all round.I like the clean crisp look they put out!I love these shoes, they look great! I usually wear a 7.5 and had to size up to an 8 in this style. There is little to no arch support so be prepared for a super flat shoe. But I don\\'t plan on hiking in these, the style is what I wanted.Super comfy and warm. Dont hesitate. Just get them. I bought them in Black too!While I love the look of these vans, especially in the beige color, the tongue of the shoe will not stay in the middle. It veers to the side and it\\'s so annoying.The photo makes it seem like the Antler color is more of a tan/brown. In reality it is more of a blush. Will be returning these.This old skool is SO sleek & cool that I bought 2 pairs. The Metallic detailing, black suede gives it a dressier look to wear out at night. One for day & one for after dark. You can\\'t go wrong!Great overall shoe.It\\'s a great-looking shoe, but it\\'s very uncomfortable. The toe area is very shallow, so my toes hit the top of the shoe. I have many other premium brands and have never had this problem before. It\\'s a great style, but the shoe designers need to actually wear their shoes to test their comfort.These shoes squeak like crazy! After just a day or two of normal wear, they started squeaking loudly and haven\\'t stopped. They\\'re so noisy that other people notice and talk about it. I regret purchasing these shoes.Love this colorful shoe.  Fun addition to wardrobe.Love this colorful shoe and it adds the perfect bit of style to my outfits.Comfortable and elegant. So I ordered one size larger than I usually wear.My son loves these shoes! My son is 16 and on the autism spectrum. He can not tie shoes. These shoes are easy for him to get on and they are stylish unlike other men\\'s slip on shoes.I love them and most importantly, my son loves them... He wanted red and he got it! We have been buying for years and we are so excited for this red and black combo and a major plus... THEY COME IN WIDEI like the style of this sneaker and they are quite light.\\nThey do run a tad big - I could have sized down by 1/2 a size but I can live with these.\\nThey are not uncomfortable though they are not the most comfortable sneaker I have ever owned.\\nI am content with my purchase but would not recommend to a \"fussy\" buyerAre these actually leather? They say they are, but they truly feel like some type of plastic. I wanted to like these. I got a pair of suede Campo style by the same brand and they seemed like good quality, and since I wanted a pair of white sneakers I tried these, hoping to get a pair that are a bit slimmer overall. None of the Veja insoles are comfortable to me, but at least one can remove the terrible insole and I switched to a Vionic insert. From a fashion standpoint, I wouldn’t give these a 1*, but the material is really bad. The tongue is especially cheap.These shoes fit great and are very comfortable.I wear a 12. These felt a little longer, which is fine. And they are wider than I thought (the description stated a medium width, but they feel wide -- great for me as my feet are a little wider). I like them as a whole.Good overall. A little bigger than I thought. But I wouldn\\'t go smaller.Fits great and Vejas seem to last forever.Felt a little tight, but I think it might’ve broken in over time. The deal breaker was the tongue that is too long and will cut across the top of your foot if you wear short socks. I can’t believe they missed this huge design flaw.Tongue is rough and cuts into instep. Very uncomfortable.Lightweight and comfortable \\nTrue to size \\nRead some reviews that the tongue was too long and uncomfortable- Mine don’t seem to have that problem.I am a size 8 with a wide foot and these felt awesome!Great shoes for going out. Wouldn’t recommend for working out. Love the style of the shoe. They do run big.They fit my bf exactly how these shoes are designed he loved the shoes for his birthday and I’m very happy with how quickly they got to our house ......definitely will be purchasing again from this siteHaving these shoes now for about a month or more anwearing them almost daily I can say they make my pinky toes hurt so bad. They feel great until I actually have to walk in them. The shoes look great but the material folds right on my pinky toes and hurts. I wanted to love these shoes because of the awesome style but I can\\'t, they\\'ve been in my closet the last 2 weeks as I went back to my old shoes. Be sure to order a half size larger as they run small. The shoes are also heavy if you were wondering; I personally don\\'t mind the weight at all. I just wish they didnt hurt my feet.I love these shoesLove rhem + looks great on foot!!Love the shoe, maybe a half size small in size but could just be they are not broken in yet.I\\'m normally between 10.5 and 11. Size 10.5 was tight in the toe, 11 fit perfectly with plenty of width and room in the toe box while keeping heel secure.  Sole is thin and flexible with zig zag tread pattern for boardfeel.  Perfect old school minimalistic skate shoe.I own them in black. Saw these were available in my size and snatched them up! I love how these shoes fit and feel!nds down some of the most comfortable shoes i\\'ve had. I used to own these about 10+ years ago and they are still amazing shoes.For my 16 yr old skateboard kid he loves themGood fit.  Great look.Right out of the box I loved these boots! Loved the color combo, but the fit and comfort really sealed the deal. I also appreciate the 40% off price. Overall a 5 out of 5!Husband loves theseFits Great and styleGreat fit and stylePerfectShoe fit fine and looked cool,  but blew out after just 10 days of skating. The ollie area right above the baby toe knuckle ripped right through. Least durable shoe I’ve ever skated. absolute trash. disappointing coming from a brand that’s supposed to be true to and made for skateboarding.Better than Vans slip on. Been skating Emerica for over 20 years. Nothing better.Simply \"OUTSTANDING\"!great casual shoe, even if your not a skaterOrder your normal size. These slip on shoes are more comfortable than vans. Removable insoles. Recommend these to anyone who is consideringI wear a size 10 1/2 for Johnson and Murphy and the 10 1/2 in the shoe was way too big. I’d suggest purchasing half to one size smaller.The shoes have a great look but these are made for a very narrow foot. I do not wear a wide shoe in any style but these hurt so much in the toebox and there is no give.Runs about 1/2 to 1 size large.Love this shoeGreat looking shoe, but the toe box is very narrow. I do not have a wide foot but these shoes get really narrow, real quick. Might they stretch with some wear, yes, but couldn’t chance it for the price. \\n\\nI usually wear a 9.5 in other shoes and the 9 fit perfectly.Overall a great purchase and the price was right..these sneakers fit and feel better than some of my more expensive sneakersThey fit perfectI still love themreal smooth looking sneakerThe fit is perfect. The shoe is one of the most comfortable I\\'ve ever worn and still feels solid an resilient. I straight lace most of my shoes including this one with a Burluti knot, but I think even with the traditional way the laces at 60 inches are way too long so I switched them for 48 inch laces, which work better.There shoes are super comfortable. It\\'s a little hard to get them on, and I feel like pull tabs on the back would be way more useful than where they are on the front, but once they\\'re on they feel great.These are cool.  Very, very comfortable, look great, and they have immediately become my everyday casual black shoes/black sneakers replacement.  I\\'m on a quest to never tie shoelaces again (1800\\'s, anyone?) and I really like these modern-looking super casual shoes.Fit just fineThe shoe is \"sexy\".  A nice blending of Chelsea and Tennis shoe that ups the game on tennis shoes.  Unfortunately I where a size 11 and this was a size smaller in feel.  Returned and reordering in a 12...wish me luck!!!A little narrow but a great shoeKind of wider.Really comfy and true to size.The shoes fit well. Very well cushioned.Every time I wear my JM gear I get compliments. Thanks for keeping me looking good and feeling good!!Great shoes that work well dressed up and dressed down and are extremely comfortable as well! This is my second pair and I almost exclusively alternate between these two pairs of shoes.They look better than expected and the soles on these are so comfortable. They fit perfectly and could not ask for a better shoe. If you like Cole Hann Sneakers, this one is a keeper.Awesome shoes but I would expect nothing less from CH.Good sizeNice fitSo comfortable!comfyThese shoes are amazing! The material is stretchy and comfortable. They make it feel like I\\'m wearing house shoes around. These are my new favorite go-to shoes. The fit is as expected, so no need to size up or down. I really, really love the brown leather details and the oceanic print.Shoes are well made, attractive and most of all very comfortable. As if they were not there yet providing arch support.Recommended by my son and I like them a lot. Easy on and very comfortable. Color combination is just what I was looking for to take on vacation. Liked them so much I bought a second pair.I had been wearing hey dudes but found I was between sizes and they lacked enough support.  These ariats thus far have proven to be more comfortable and fit better.These shoes make me feel like I\\'m on the moon crip-walking and everyone back on earth can see my sick moves and wishes they could rocket-propel themselves up and get on my level. With these sweet kicks now that dream is a reality. Come moon-walk with me.I\\'ve always had a thing for Globe shoes, they haven\\'t disappointed me yet and these are no exception.My husband won\\'t wear anything but globe shoes, and they last him for a least a year & that\\'s with everyday wear and so we bought these for our 14 year old son because he\\'s so hard on shoes, hoping they last longer. My son says they are the most comfortable pair of shoes he\\'s ever had, and he\\'s going to buy another pair himself because he likes them so much. We have always had good luck with globe shoes and they fit good, there stylish, affordable, and durable.Great shoes! Just a little tighter that expected. Maybe order 1\\\\2 size larger then normal.My husband is always buying skate shoes but these shoes are by far the best ones yet. Quality is excellent and they keep their shape good. Also Zappos was the best price around plus free shipping! I\\'m a customer for life!Size was just perfect.  I haven\\'t had Sperry shoes in years, so was a little worried.  But no worries!  The shoes are very nice and I like the shape and appearance of them.  It was a good value too, in my opinion, compared to the options I considered for white, leather non-athletic shoes that would look good with a suit or jeans.Thumbs up!These are extremely comfortable. The toe box is slightly wider than most other comparable shoes out there and may be my favorite thing about them. I misplaced my no-show socks so I have been wearing these barefoot for up to 12 hours a day and they are super comfortable to the point where I will most likely keep wearing them without socks.Great fit, super comfy and stylish!Very comfortable, stylish and true to size.  I ordered a white pair to add to my collection.I own two pairs of these shoes and absolutely love them! They are super comfortable and fit just right. There is some lady on here saying they slip off and when you tighten them they cut into her husbands feet. There is a happy middle there lady. Don\\'t tighten them too tight. Also she says something about them smelling like cat pee after wearing them which sounds like her husband has an issues with his feet. They don\\'t smell like cat pee when you get them and they don\\'t after months of wearing them. I literally came here to buy another pair and saw that stupid review. Sounds like she is working for a competitor or something trying to tarnish a good company. There is absolutely no way the shoes will just randomly start smelling like cat pee. Her husband needs to get his feet checked out by a doctor. I love mine and highly recommend them! I wear them all the time and they are still holding up very nice and don\\'t smell like cat pee.Great fit and great feel!! Comfortable all day long!!Most comfortable shoe, beating hey dudes by a mile.So comfy my go to traveling shoes when i fly and visiting familyThese are very comfortable shoes.  They are well made and durable.  Definitely won\\'t be my last pair I purchaseSuper comfortableNice fit and feel.  I wished my basketball shoes had soles that grip this well.  Patriotic as well!!!!You can play basketball or wear causally and look nice should have premium leather tho. Don;t be like Nike they have cheap leather on all there retro shoes feels like cardboard.The shoe looks great & appears to be well built.  It\\'s EVA midsole doesn\\'t seem to be very thick. The shoe provides only \\'OK\\' cushioning for walking/court use.  Old Club C85s are better cushioned.This is a good looking shoe; it\\'s comfortable and excellent as a walk about shoe. I also used it on the treadmill and had no issues.Great to wear any place.Like the comfort the style the look I\\'ve been rocking them since receiving them as my workout shoesShoes feel like wooden coffins on your feet. Very uncomfortable and the bottom is a hard plastic nightmare.Make no mistake about it, these run a full size short.  The 11\\'s are exactly as long as my US size 10 Rockport casual shoes.  Since I usually wear a 10 and at least EE, these 11\\'s are a tight fit (but just the right length); however, I find them so stylish that at this price, I am keeping them.I was looking for a lower-profile, lighter-colored, somewhat \"fashionable\" sneaker, but with some durability, and so far these seem to fit the bill nicely. The white color is a canvas-like material that breathes well. I wear no-show socks a lot with my shoes and my feet sweating can be an issue with certain shoes (e.g. suede), but so far I haven\\'t had that issue with these Golas. They do seem just a touch on the small side though. My only complaint is the material they lined the inside of the heel cup with rubs my socks and makes an awkward noise. I\\'m hoping that goes away after they\\'re broken in; it could just be an issue with the no-show socks I wear though.These fit true to size, I have several pairs of different Gola styles. I ordered these to replace the Harriers I purchased that were too small, but the size up in these were too big and I ended up needing my usual Gola size. They\\'re stylish and I hope they hold up well.Love the low profile of these; easy to pack, and wear well with a variety of looks.These shoes work great for me because I wear an AFO due to my having drop foot.  It\\'s much easier to get it on and off.Bought them from grandson who is physically challenged. The zipper really helps him to get his shoes on by himself. They also look great. He loves his Billy\\'s!!!I was introduced to Billy Footware through my son Micah, who has CP. Now they are my favorite pair of shoes! So comfortable and easy to put on. Love this style. I\\'m also going to be grabbing a pair of high-tops soon. You will not be disappointed by these shoes!Great shoes, fit as expected. Recommend them highlyBought these for my husband in grey.  He liked them so much, I ordered the black.  He has balance issues & he said these shoes are stable, fit him perfectly & cushion his feet.  Very nice looking on the foot.  I purchased his normal size - 10 1/2/M.With regular cole haan lace up oxfords im an 11 1/2 wide, perfect fit. These, in 11 1/2 wide, are a tad too small. I\\'m gonna try a 12 wide.Nice for drivingGreat style, simple in designI discovered Billy shoes about 2 years ago and have been a loyal customer since.  These suede Chukkas are great.  They provide the ankle support similar to a boot, yet the zipper allows me to easily get them on and off with just the help of a dressing stick and minimal effort.  They are comfortable, and stylish. As an adult with a movement restricting disability, I love that Billy shoes have given me back some independence without looking like typical orthopedic shoes.I needed to wear a brace so I purchased this shoe so I could get my foot in with the brace. It works great.I started with a 10 M, went to a 10.5 W, and ended up with a 10 W, which fit perfectly for me! Grate quality shoe, and soooo easy to put on/get off!Very easy to put on and remove (I\\'m a paraplegic and use a wheelchair)! Also, very comfortable!I bought these for my father who has two artificial hips and knees.  Also he had a bad bunion surgery.  These shoes are easy for him to get on and provide the support and comfort that he needs.  Having the wide width available is definitely a plus for his feet.  I highly recommend these shoes!Comfortable. Like the looks, price was great.Perfect. All is good. Got her a day before I left for Las Vegas and used shoes a few days. Shoes are nice looking, fits well, and are comfortable. It was a good purchase. Absolutely no regrets.Since I own the Saucony Originals Jazz in black, I wanted to try them in blue. Apparently it\\'s not quite the same style; it\\'s wider, different fabric, and the tongue it different too. Really bummed they didn\\'t work because I would have bought more colors.NOT like the original Jazz!  Tongue is completely different, not padded, rough sewn edge (also not padded) and juts into the front of ankle.  Sole material used to be cushiony and have a slight bounce as it absorbed shock.  New sole is dead, has no absorption.  I have worn this brand and model for 25 year, I am so sad to have lost another well made original design to the corporate greed of cheap production.If you have high arches, this shoe you will very likely want to use them. Perfect comfort with orthotics!\\n\\nLet\\'s assume you will slip orthotics in this...\\n\\nLOVE, LOVE AND LOVE these shoes!\\nWant to make Jazz Saucony my signature brand!\\n\\nThese shoes just make me smile :-) Happy Disney-type brights and a wide selection of options. I am ready looking for more in other colors.\\n\\nI just need them for standing, walking and looking like a signature statement on stages. These will replace my wearing heels. So looking forward to returning to pre-COVID life and keynote speaking. \\n\\nFor me, if I get known for having \"fun shoes\" when talking/ training on a hard subject  (urgent eldercare), this is a good thing.\\n\\nThese shoes are built like a Sketcher. Expect a thin shoe -tongue. Inner sole pulls out to fit orthotics. Heel is neutral. Comes with two sets of laces, orange and white. The underlay in UV fabric changes color in sun. Shoes can be waterproofed, which may help keep these looking new.\\n\\nJust very exciting shoes for looks on so many levels! If you want show compliments, these shoes likely will have that charisma. Perfect style for anyone often described as \"too serious.\"\\n\\nKeep people guessing!\\n\\n* Go up 1/2 size for orthotics. Unisex shoes will run wider. Great if you have dancer/ gymnastics feet or arthritis bunions etc.\\n\\nWith laces, you can adjust width.\\n\\nIf you are between sizes, go up a 1/2 size if you want a wider toe box.Love these shoes! They are soooo comfortable. I\\'ve been wearing them everywhere, all day - on walks and on the side lines of my boys\\' baseball games. And I love the blue color and styling!These are the most comfortable sneakers I have ever worn. They were supremely comfortable right out of the box, no breaking in needed. I bought 2 pairs, one black and one orange. The orange are my favorite. They always add a great pop of color. I love them!!Hey Dude Will always be the best! The fit is perfect, and the more you wear them, the more they conform to your feet. The patriotic ones are perfect for a classic American summer. I have 5 pairs, and 0 regrets.I ordered size 11, they say 11, obviously mislabeled as they are bigger than both my other size 11. I sent a comment earlier and never heard anything. I know they were a close out but I should get credit as there is obviously a sizing mistake here\\'MERICA! Husband loved these & raves how comfortable they are!Perfect for inauguration day! Will also be great for 4th of July, Veteran\\'s Day and Memorial Day. Also just great for everyday patriotism.Had to have these to wear on Flag Day, July 4th, Veterans Day or just to celebrate the USALove these. Had to order one size largerExcellent comfortable neutral shoes for any wardrobe!  I love the company’s sustainable philosophy.  If you’re looking for comfortable daily wear or travel sneakers with a neutral vibe these are the ones for you!Awesome shoes. I get several compliments. They feel great and look true to the photo.very comfortable. I love how sturdy they feel and how nice they look. I usually wear a 40 in European sizes, but had read in other reviews to order one size up. I’m glad I listened and ordered a size 41.These shoes run at least two sizes smaller. I normally wear a 41. The 42 was still too small. Waiting to receive the 43.Great shoes. Finally a truely a wide pair of shows from Cole Haan.I got these as a gift, I’ve purchased Cole Haan shoes before, but easily these are THE most comfortable shoe I have ever wornGreat shoe.The heel height was too low for me.This stile runs at least 1 full size larger. It’s HUGE.Feel great and look really good. Would love the soles in other than white. Like black. Navy or gray.I have not purchased Cole Haan shoes in while due to them being too narrow. I am pleasantly surprised that this shoe is very comfortable and the appropriate width. I am excited that I now have Cole Haan as option for purchase.The fit is great. These shoes feel like walking on air. I love the style and comfort.Amazing shoes! My husband loves them for work!  They also got here really fast which was very convenient.Bought this pair of Lacoste Bayliss for my dad over the holidays as a gift and he absolutely loves it. It\\'s super light weigh (which he enjoys) and high quality for it\\'s price. I was going back and forth between the white sole or the full black. However, I did end up with full black since it gives off a less sneaker feel to it and will look better when he wears a suit. The laces is a rough material and does not have a true black color. It looks painted I have a feeling it might chip off. I\\'ll give it a few more weeks to see if that\\'s the case. Overall, the shoes are very comfortable given the soft cushion, and the soft leather lining. From his description, it fits him like a glove and provide great arch support. He\\'s been wearing with socks so there weren\\'t too much effort needed to break-in the shoes.I like the shoes and the fit, but there is a fair amount of white paint that is chipping off around the top of the laces. Wore once.GoodfineGreat fit, feel comfortableI always by the Merrell Jungle Mocs but this year I decided to try these out and I couldn\\'t be happier I\\'m not happy that my wife has a horse and sleeps with all the neighbors but I\\'m happy about these shoes I\\'m kidding about the horse we don\\'t have a horse.I use these specifically as a ranch outdoors working and piddling shoes and they’ve completely replaced all of my more traditional boots. Comfort level is amazing and they are holding up great to all the abuse I’ve given them. Will buy another pair soon just to have a spare set. One for dirty work and one for the evenings.I really liked the shoe.  Seems very well made, comfortable, looks good etc.  However the EE width feels too tight.Rear of the sole came unglued after a couple of monthsFits small and tight, order wides and shoes were very narrow stillMost skate shoes are a fashion statement, but the Globe Fusion & Sabres are the real deal. \\nBoth shoes feature a unique tongue that connects to heel collar which keeps the tongue in place. The ankle is entirely padded, extending down to the heel counter. The shoe offers better than average protection from board injury. The toes start off stiff but break in at the flex point, offering decent dexterity. The other thoughtful design points, pull tabs on the tongue, simple sole texture allows for decent grip and reinforced bottom eyelet. They\\'re more comfortable than than the average skate shoe, mostly due to the tongue design, as it always stays and place and doesn\\'t smash itself against your ankle. The Sabres offer better heel padding, nice if you\\'re jumping up and down. They run slightly wide, which work well for my wide feet, although I still had to buy slightly large. They also come in dark colors, to hide the wear and tear of skating. They could last a little longer in the sole, 6 months of daily skating and these things are toast, although this is average for skate shoes for me. Your mileage will vary based on skate habits. If you\\'re looking for comfort, protection.I love Globes! They are the best shoe ever. I walk on concrete and my dog chewed my last pair so I ordered this pair because of the innersock. I love how it molds to your foot. Just glad to be the one who got to get the last one in my size. Thanks Zappos!I ordered these shoes for our daughter for a gift. She wanted a new pair to replace an old pair of the same brand shoe. Zappos is an amazing site to use. I was not able to find the shoes in her size until I checked Zappos. And there they were! I was thrilled and our daughter loves the shoes. She says that the fit is great and they are so cushy. She says it feels like you are walking on pillows. I have always had good shopping experiences with Zappos. The web site is easy to navigate, the ordering process is very smooth and once I had to return something for a different size and the process was very easy and quick. They even offer free shipping. What could be better then that? I will always come back to Zappos.Great shoe. Been riding Freelines in them with no problem. Comfortable and they look pretty boss too. Globe never lets me down.I love these shoes. I bought them a couple years ago. Then when I wore the heel out of those I bought another pair. My favorite colorway was the all white with black toe, I wish they did not discontinue it. The second time I got the black/charcoal/white which is almost the exact same but with a grey panel in there. I am normally a 7 in mens shoes (8½ in womens), but I needed a 7½ in these. They are very comfortable and have nice, thick ankle padding. Once my current pair wears out I am getting another pair!Great support and super comfortable for casual upscale look.Most comfortable shoe I own.Very comfortable and great looking shoe!!Husdand says he\\'s walking on cloudsDressy Sneaker you can wear with suitsThese shoes look great and fit great.  A terrific find for casual wear or work.They fit true to size and feel wonderful. It\\'s like walking on pillows all day. They are veritile in style and will work with business casual or jeans. I love them.! I bought another color as well. (Blue) these are my daily go to shoes. Born is a great brand and has a terrific track record.Hubby wound up with a different pair from Born rather than this style.  These were okay, but aren\\'t as stylish and weren\\'t quite as comfortable as he prefers.  Overall, then are just okay.Not wide enough for my husband\\'s feet. The red is also not as bright as the photo. I like it, but it\\'s a more faded look than online.I love the look of this shoe, but this shoe was just not a comfortable shoe at all and I found it to fit very narrow and be uncomfortable. It honestly left blisters on both get after about 4 hours of wear in a casual (Mostly standing) environment. I would be weary of ordering this shoe if you are not familiar with the fit or have worn it before, unless you have very narrow feet. I would instead choose the Sperry Wahoo, for me it is a much better fit. Zaps customer service however is top notch, and took care of the issue, no better place to purchase footwear.Great boat shoe. Traditional look but very functional as it drys fast, grips well and doesn\\'t leave marks or dirt. \\n\\nCustomer service department and shipping at Zappos is the BEST!!!!Love \\'em. Classics. I get a pair at the beginning of every summer.I\\'m really happy Sperry brought this shoe out for Spring. There\\'s nothing quite more perfect to celebrate the end of Winter than a pair of fresh white kicks. Unlike Sperry\\'s \\'Striper\\', this shoe is a study in classic minimalism. No bulky padded tongue or collar, and the bright optical white make it a natural over at the yacht or tennis club. The shoe does seem to run a bit small. Definitely order at least a half size larger than usual, perhaps even a full size. It also seems a bit on the narrow side. All in all, a great classic look (and it\\'s less than the Sperry webstore!). By all means check it out!I wear a 12. These felt a little longer, which is fine. And they are wider than I thought (the description stated a medium width, but they feel wide -- great for me as my feet are a little wider). I like them as a whole.great styling but not advisable for long walkThese shoes fit great and are very comfortable.Good overall. A little bigger than I thought. But I wouldn\\'t go smaller.Good looking sneaker. Comfortable except for tongue that caused blister on upper ankle area on one side only.After reading the reviews, I felt I should write a review that perhaps could clarify what the shoes are intended for. These shoes DO NOT REPEL WATER, nor were they designed to do that. These shoes are boat shoes as well as water shoes. After a three day trip on the Bighorn River in Montana, I can attest to the fact these shoes are great. The soles provided perfect, no slip traction while casting on the drift boat and then when it was time to wet-wade, they were fantastic submerged in the water, protecting my feet from rocks and the river\\'s bottom. I can not recommend these shoes more. They work and do do perfectly.fit really well. Lots of room for my toes! Almost feel like I\\'m wearing slippers!!Good looking and stylish sneaker. Great fit and very versatile.Im very happy with my new watershoes. I havent used them yet. But they are amazing so far. They feel like they are apart of my foot. They do run a bit big because you dont usr a sock. So i would recommend ordering them a half size smaller to get that exact fit.Bought two pairs of the same shoe to get the right size.Not good I need size 12 manThey fit tight and bottoms were paper thinThey fit fine and look nice. The sticking started coming out less than 2 weeks after I received them.Love the height and color of these shoes! I\\'m usually a 7.5-8 and bought an 8. They are a bit loose but I think it\\'s because they\\'re on the heavier side. Nothing a thicker no show sock can\\'t fix.Just got my shoes today and I absolutely LOVE them! they fit like a glove and are so comfortable.I love these shoes. I thought the platform would be an issue and it wasn\\'t. The shoes are true to size. I have a wide and flat foot and the style of these shoes did not cause any discomfort. I hope they keep this style as a classic.I really thought that the color was like a peachy color but they are tan.they look really good on and are not hard to walk in.These shoes look great in person and are very comfortable. I will\\nBe purchasing similar styles in th near future. And the size fitting is perfect, I got a 7.5 and it runs true to size.They are cute. They hurt the back of your heels when you drive. And if you wear them with jeans, they are completely ruined because they stain.They fit well and are more comfortable on my feet then Nike\\'s, Jordan\\'s and Converse. I can walk longer in these sneakers. I wish I could do a commercial on theses sneakers. I have bad feet and these sneakers work wonders for me. They were given to me as a gift the first time and now I am hooked on them. Love Vans!!Yooooooo vans is doing the thang! These new tapered hi-tops are EVERYTHING! I will always have these in my shoe repertoire lineup. Will always keep me a pair of vans.Loved everything about this drop.  They are more comfortable than the last collabs. They are subtle to outlast the barbie craze. They are so perfect!They are so cute in person and comfortable. I thought I would have to break them in but no! I was about to wear them all day. Someone said they are narrow, but they are not I got my normal size and I have hella room. I could have size down if I wanted too. That\\'s how spacious they are.We never received the shoes so IDK how they fit they never was deliveredLooks and feels terrificComfort 100%, Look 100%, overall rating for the shoe 5+ Stars!great look and fellI now have 2 pair, in brown and grey. This shoe is very light weight, fits perfectly, and durable.Look exactly as pictured and fit very well.true to size, but over time they do break in to become just a little loose, which is how I like my boat shoes.  Very comfortable.  The leather and fabric are very well stitched.  This summer will make 3 years that I\\'ve had my shoes.  When they get wet, just take the insole out of it and let it dry with a little baking soda, and voila, no moisture and no smell.  Fantastic shoes for the boater.  Mine are the dark brown fabric and tan leather.  No tears, and nothing falling apart as of yet.  My second pair haven\\'t even been worn yet.  Highly recommend !!!nice summer shoeSuper comfortable. Ordered wides and they were actually wide!I love these shoes,Fit perfectly. Breathable, light and comfortable.The item is as described.\\nA little narrow for wide feet.\\nMaybe buy a 1/2 size bigger.\\nThe shoe provides ankle support.\\nI wear them for work as I am\\non my feet a great deal and\\ndo much walking in them.\\nThese shoes are helpful\\nbut may not last too long because\\nthe sole of the shoe is thin.\\nYes, I would recommend this shoe.These are the best. I just hope we see more color combos in the futureNice and comfortable.I love these sneakers. They are a great material. They\\'re very comfortable and look great with many styles. I get lots of compliments.they feel so nice and look even better than I remembered tooThis is my 6th pair of black Stags w/ the gum sole.\\nThe perfect all around shoes for everyday wear.\\nYou must get one full size larger than normal, I\\'m a size 11.....that means size 12 fits perfectly.Zappos customer service is amazing! I ordered shoes for a Christmas gift and they ended up not fitting. I was able to return them with free shipping and ordered different shoes which I received in 2 days! My luck the new shoes didn\\'t fit either so I called and was able to order the correct size immediately without having to wait for my return to be received. Again the shoe came in 2 days and I was able to return the other shoes free shipping! Amazing! I will be ordering again! By the way, these shoes were perfect and look great on!Took a little bit to break them in but after that they were just OK.  No support and not comfortable for standing long periods of time.  They have lasted long enough without showing any signs of falling apart yet.  The tongue is a bit too thick but they are supposed to be skate shoes so I expected it.We returned the 9.5s originally (had another pair in that size that fit), but these were just a little tighter. So went up to a 10. The customer service was Awesome!! Called and talked to a wonderful person and she was able to sort it all out and get my signed up for the loyalty program too to save us so much time on shipping! I won\\'t buy shoes anywhere else now. You have a customer for life.Perfect shoe and design.Great fit, great look, soles fell off in four months after moderate use.I bought these shoes for my 14 year old son and within 3 weeks both shoes had fallen apart. Although he liked the style and fit, they did not hold up for a teenager. The soles of the shoe came apart. I did get a refund and was very happy with Zappos in general on how they handled the situation.Great product and qualityPerfect skateboarding shoe--high top protecting your ankles on the sides (but with deep cutaway in the back/achilles allowing for great movement), and low-profile sole that\\'s wide with a thinner insole keeping you close to the board.Very comfortable sneakers. I bought the pink ones. They fit great. I would definitely recommend these.These are my first pair of Globe and I can now say Globe is my new favorite shoe company. In comparison to Osiris which I\\'ve worn for years, they\\'re more comfortable and much more durable (I\\'ve worn the same pair everyday for 8 months and they still have plenty of life left in them). I was drawn to the style of them which reminded me of Osiris before they started to only make neon colored high top crap. They\\'re also good for lifting in.Extremely comfortable solid feeling shoe - \\nI was very impressed when I first tried these shoes on. I myself tend to like \"bigger\" shoes and the sabres do the trick. Honestly, I wish that globe still made the Chet Thomas IV shoes, but these seem to be close to the design as far as comfort is concerned. These shoes are well built and also feel incredibly solid and durable. I would highly recommend these to anyone who likes the bigger shoes or laments the death of the Chet Thomas IV like me :DI love these shoes very comfortable and the best part is the attached tongue makes this one of the best skate shoes out there. If you\\'re like me and like to just throw on your shoes without having to tie them, then this is the shoe for you. Lace \\'em up with the bars straight across and cut the rest of lace off and then you can slip them on and off very easy and quick with no tieing of the laces or you can just stuff extra on sides.I had tried many other brands of skate shoes, and after buying my first pair of Globes years ago, I had never bought a different brand. The quality-comfort-style combo outmatches any other brand out there. The soles on these particular shoes felt a little stiff, but overall a great shoe. Also, I always buy from Zappos. I picked out and paid for these during the day, and they were literally on my doorstep the next day! And free fast shipping like this? I love it.Zappos is the way to go, my shoes came in right when they said they\\'d be here. As for the shoes, I\\'ve never had such a comfortable pair in my life. If I could, I would give a 10 star rating! Unless they make an upgraded version of these by the time the ones I\\'m wearing now wear out, I\\'ll be ordering a new pair, same brand, from this same company...well, maybe a different color.One of the best High Top sneaker on the market. \\nComparable with Supra Skytops. \\n5 stars plus on Style,  Classic Style,  comfort,  and support. \\nLove the wider feel and larger sizes due to my larger foot. \\nIt\\'s very hard to find larger size 15 - 18.\\nThat\\'s a major plus..Love \\'em. Great support all around. Can walk for miles. Babe magnets.Skate shoes dont come with arch support. But they fit great they look great and i love them!Yes Absolutely the #1 Shoe Brand I\\'ve been wearing for years! They are a very durable Shoe!Best fitting shoes like color and feelNormally I wear a 14, a 15 on rare occasions. And this 15 fit me tighter than most 14s would. Seemed a full size smaller. Otherwise seems like a nice, stylish shoe. I\\'d recommend ordering a size larger, at least in the larger sizes.Recently purchased this shoe before traveling to Europe for 3 weeks. Like the style. Luck that I also took my Bostonian Slip Ons. This was the most uncomfortable shoe I have ever owned. Believe it was just very poor manufacturing. Left shoe was okay but right almost caused a blister on the top of my foot and the top of my large toe. The tongue of the left shoe keep moving to the inside of my shoe and only constant adjustment make the shoe better. After 5 days of trying \"break in\", I simply stopped wearing. I cannot recommend this shoe in the least.Hey, these are classic cool. Old school styling, new school comfort. Beautiful colors. Hit the football pitch or just be beyond trendy on the streets... you can\\'t go wrong if you\\'ve got the clothes to match.All black Pumas, you can wear those to work and no one can see the stains.  But slow down Kevin, these pumas are small.  If you wear 11s, you are gonna want to get the 12s, you hear.  And you are probably gonna want to wear skinny jeans and your Toxic Holocaust tee shirt with these.  Now you are cool Kevin.  Good Job.  But now hold on one more second.  These are not constructed so great.  Soles started to peel off before I\\'m used to this happening.  Looks pretty tough though.  Get a grip and pay the man Kevin.These are my ‘go-to’ everyday shoes, and have worn through a couple pairs over the years.  The foam rubber soles aren’t the most durable, but while they last they are wonderfully soft and comfortable to walk in, run in, or just stand in.The shoes look great. I love the style of them, but they have not been comfortable at all. They are extremely narrow. The outer edge of the inside of the shoes are really uncomfortable. After a full day of using them, they felt a tiny bit better, but I feel like I\\'m going to need to find a way to widen the inside of the shoes. If you have wide or just not narrow feet, be aware these shoes run narrow.These are my 1st Vejas. The fit and comfort is really good, a tad below the comfort of running sneakers, and I walked for 2 miles without any issues. I really like how these shoes are made, I’m a fan now.Looks fantastic. Super thrilled about the leather quality and the fact that it\\'s processed with no heavy metals. Tongue is a little stiff but not as big of a deal as I read in other reviews. I feel that they\\'ll break in perfectly.Not the most comfortable shoe but they look amazing!These might be my favorite shoes! I’ve bought a lot of other sneakers (including some for $600!!) that just weren’t comfortable and cute but these fit the bill for both! Strongly recommendYou know every once in a while when you get that magical pair of shoes that requires no time breaking them in and they instantly just work perfectly?\\n\\nWell, these are them. They feature ultra-soft leather and they mold to your feet after just a couple of wears. They can be styled with jeans, dresses, or anything really, and are the perfect white sneaker. \\n\\nI wore these all around Disneyland  the very first weekend I received them. I am very picky about which shoes I\\'ll wear all day and often opt for my runners. Now that I have these, my Veja Recife sneakers will be my go-to every day shoes.Normally wear between a 44 and 45, went with other reviewers and ordered the 44.  Unfortunately they were too small, but maybe only a half a size.  I think they would have been great in a 44.5.\\n\\nOrdered the Terrazzo Leather colorway.  They look like the picture, I enjoyed their aesthetic and they would be great in most casual settings.  \\n\\nLike other reviewers stated, the materials are a little stiff but I would imagine they would break in with wear. The tongue could stand to be a tad shorter as I can see them digging into your ankle during the break-in period.  \\n\\nOverall I enjoyed them, probably would have kept them if they were in my size.  Zappos made returning them extremely easy, as per usual.These look really good on and I’m I glad I read other reviews about sizing. I wear an 8.5/9 and went with the mens 7 and they fit great (toe space and width). The tongue length is not a problem at all. They are stiff though and I definitely would remove the insole and insert a great quality one with arch and heel support. Would order other styles.There’s lotsa talk about sizing & Theeee tongue so I thought I’d chime-in. These are men’s sizes. I wear a womens 9 & the Veja10 size 7 fits perfectly. it might be more accurate if you know your European size. Wms9=Mens7=Euro40\\nThe tongue really is Not an issue. Maybe some people’s personal ankle anatomy isn’t compatible, but for me it’s a non-issue\\nI’m not sure how they’ll wear yet, but they seem very sturdy and well made\\nThese are super comfy right outta the box. The insole is super thick (& removable) and comfy\\nCute style Comfy shoe Highly recommendThe shoe runs big but is stylish and of great quality!The shoes are very stylidh but not as comfortable.Nice looking shoe, but the sole did start to pull away from the upper portion of the shoe within a month of purchase. For that reason, I would not recommend it.My trusty Chucks recently wore out, and now that I\\'m solidly in my thirties, I:\\nA) Didn\\'t want to be the creepy almost-middle aged guy in Converse\\nB) Wanted a comfortable sneaker, but still looked good.\\n\\nI\\'ve came across the Gola Comets, and based on my previous experience with the brand, thought I\\'d give them a shot.  Two weeks in and I\\'m really happy with them.  I wanted a basic canvas sneaker that fit well, and these have delivered.  I was a little concerned they\\'d be a little tight, but are exactly true to size.\\n\\nIf you\\'re also looking for a basic canvas sneaker with an old school flare (and an alternative to Chuck Taylors), you really can\\'t go wrong.I like these sneakers, but about a month after having them, the glue started coming apart on the rubber around the sole. A little bit after that, the glue is coming undone in a couple more places. I\\'ve fixed the bottom with Gorilla Glue. I shouldn\\'t have to be repairing sneakers I buy so shortly after buying them though. I\\'m also a little disappointed with how some of the threading is pulling off of the logo design on the sides. The sneakers are super comfortable. If it weren\\'t for the flaws with the stitches and the separation, I\\'d be thrilled with these kicks.I have tried the size 10 which is a little big and then the 9 feels too small. The difference between a 9 and 10 seems more than I would expect. I wish they sold a 9 1/2.I bought these in April. It\\'s now the end of the July and they\\'re totally worn out. On the inside all the lining has sloughed off the heel and now it\\'s just some squeeky plastic. The sole is worn totally through at the heel and in the front the tread has worn down flat. They\\'re not even my primary everyday shoe.\\n\\nI knew they were cheap shoes and didn\\'t expect much. But I did expect to get more than 4 months of part-time wear out of them.The material inside the shoe makes it hard to wear socks I gotta be pulling up my socks like every minute. The material inside is really badI love these! The color is vibrant and the suede is smooth. Classic style never fails. Looking forward to wearing this summer.These will look great with short or casul summer dress.Very comfortable and excellent fitting shoe.I enjoy the shoe as well as the color. It works for me.I had these shoes as a kid and still love them. Super comfy and go with everything!Size 13 was perfect for me, nice width too because I have a bit flatter foot than the normal human. Classic style, goes great with some jeans.Good qualityLove these so much! I even convinced my sister to get a pairIt looks great with my clothings but most of all comfortable. Love it!Love the shoes, they look great, have a nice retro feel to them. #sweepstakesOrdered these for my growing pre-teen son, who previously had the Bandit 2. He is very pleased to find something similar. The Bandit 2 held up for about a year of HARD daily wear (lots of outdoor play), so I\\'m hoping these will as well.Excellent style, excellent design, but too narrow for my feet and too long for my size.My son likes them. Great feel and quality.Perfect ?GreatThis line of shoes have been everything I’ve wanted and needed. The soles are thick and don’t wear easily, the shape/materials of the shoes are consistent (I try to eliminate creases), and the shoes are stylish and be used for business casual and casual wear. I have a total of 8 pairs of these shoes (all different variations).  There are two additional colors I’ll purchase before my collection is complete.Great shoe.Great  color,confortables,we love itRuns true to length for my wide foot, but I could see someone with a narrow or even medium foot sizing down a half-size, due to the wider toe box. I\\'ve never seen a toe shaped like this in a legit sk8 shoe. And the outsole is not like the Marana, but thinner. Rest of shoe is thick. (May not look good with tighter pants?) These fit more like the length of a Lakai or Emerica, but without the pointy toe. I have to size up with the NewBalance vulcs (255, 306, and 379), but not these.I started skating in the late 80s so I\\'ve seen many shoes come and go or come and stay and hope this one sticks around. ES Accel o.g. or some variation is my typical go to but at 42 yrs old this shoe would for sure be my go to if you guys brought back the original brown color way or something similar. Maybe solid grey with a gum sole?  Some of the NB kicks are a little narrow but this one runs a little larger in the toe area which is great because it doesn\\'t rub the toe raw.  Fits perfect with an FP high profile insole upgrade. Super grippy soles, and so far haven\\'t burned a flip trick hole through where I normally would have already with other shoes. I even started using them as a summer work shoe and it\\'s held up to 7 12 hr days  a week. Most comfortable skate shoe I\\'ve owned so far but give us some more solid color way options.Everything is great with the shoe comfort and size wise but I must have gotten a defective pair as the glue around the sole is starting to show and coming out of the sole of the shoe :(received used! run big need to down size..I do not skateboard any more but I got these just for casual wear. They are very comfy while also being super sturdy. Because of their firmness, i laced them so that I can just tuck the laces into the shoe (instead of tie them) and have no issues. Also due to their neutral color I can rock them with almost any fit.Much smaller than my other Puma\\'s in the same sizeThese are comfortable, stylish, and have held up considerably well during relaxed office attire for covid times.  Highly recommend, unless you’re planning to walk more than 2 miles.I had to return at it was half a size smaller than my normal size.I had to return the first set because the size was not accurate. The next size up fit properly.Good fall/spring casual sneaker.  Not a lot of squish, but it makes up for it in style.We are not happy how these shoes aged in 2 weeks. If you like the antique look, these shoes are for you. We wanted these shoes to hold up with the original black leather look.I’ve had these for a couple of years and they fit great, super comfortable and love the understated yet clean styling. \\n\\nI have a narrow foot with a high arch. Leather has held up well. Clean and condition the leader once or twice a year depending on the abuse they get and they still look really clean.Great shoe, colors just right. Comfortable, but not “oh, ah” comfortable like some shoes. Not a lot of arch support, but wear an orthotic so it works fine. I wear an 12 in these, 11 were to tight, but normally I wear an 11, sometimes a 10.5, but having foot issues, I ordered a size up just to fit right and they run a little narrow at the toes, so to compensate for that, I ordered a size up.i really like these shoes But the color shade was different for each shoe ... Looked like 2 different shoes. Wish both had the same authentic look . Sadly had to return them.I bought these last year, and they are quite comfortable to walk and with a lot of style.\\nJos, Lisbon, PortugalThe sole is more comfortable for sure and the leather reinforcements are right where they need to be based on where the previous canvas shoe would tear. However, definitely a little more narrow and runs smaller than the previous version (11.5 previously, but now would prefer a 12). The branding was previously better too, much more subtle, more is not better.  Overall good shoe.very comfortable excellent fitGreat shoes, very classy...runs slightly larger than the other CH shoes I have though.Shoes were too narrow. I own a few CH shoes and theese were too narrow. I ordered my usual size.Great business casual or casual shoe. Added my own inserts for comfort and they look great!These are the most comfortable shoes that I own and are and easy transfer between casual and office.  Feel very much like a sneaker, but still works well for work for business casual.  I struggle with plantar fasciitis and I can walk in these all day.  Purchased in two colors (clay / lemongrass and vapor / trench blue) and much prefer the way the clay looks.my husband really wanted to try this brand, but unfortunately, they don’t offer wide width. all were too tight for his foot.I have these in three colors. The best casual sneaker that can be dressed up or down.Very comfortable and true to sizeGreat everyday shoeUnfortunately the looked like clown shoes on me.  Just not my style.These are NOT the quality of HEY Dudes I have bought before (I have 4 other pairs). The soles are cheap \"plastic like\" material, and I doubt they will last 3 months. VERY DISAPPOINTINGVery comfortable and lightweight.Looks great and comfortable to walk in.Very stylish and comfortableNice looking shoes and would fit great on narrower feet. I own plenty of Vans but these were too narrow for my feet and cramped my toes.So I had a problem with the first order for these but Vans sent out another pair and I know they\\'ll hit the mark. they got the comfycush in\\'m! Them things are dope and should be in all of their sneakers but anywho, I\\'m excited to get them and try them on but again, I know they\\'ll be as expected.The break in time on these was about 20 min. Seriously, an hour later it felt as if I had been wearing them for 6 months \\n\\nSo cute. Perfect for preschool teachers. \\n\\nI wear them with jersey knit t shirt dresses and get a ton of compliments ! ?Great Vans. I have always worn an 11.5 in Vans. It I had to order a half size up. Thea are highly comfortable and pretty light. I’m a middle school teacher and my brutally honest students have told me, without prompting, they are cool shoes.Wore these for the first time today and think I would be happy if I had them in every color and never wore any other shoes for the rest of my life. I typically wear a 7.5 or 8 (women\\'s) and ordered these in 8. Saw some other reviewers mention that they felt narrow up front, but I have weirdly bulbous pinky toes that stick out on both feet, and they didn\\'t rub them or feel too tight at all. They are fantastic!way way too narrow to be listed as a regular sized width. it was painful to put these on.I thought the Tongue of the shoe was unfinished, until I reviewed pictures onNB website. Also, I wish more NB shoes were made in the USA. I\\'d buy more and pay more for anything Made in the USA.Great looking shoe, but lacked a good heel cup for a locked in feel. Also this shoe is a bit more narrow than expected. I wear orthotics, these shoes were barely wide enough to accommodate them at the arch.Like any shoe, the shape of your foot has a big impact on how the shoe feels. I have wide toe boxes, high arches, and skinny heels. This shoe fits me better than most skate shoes have. The white leather version doesn\\'t hide scuffs very well, but it held up much longer than suede shoes. For a cup sole, it has great board feel and little to no break in time. I wouldn\\'t recommend wearing them without socks - they get stinky quick but I typically skate in socks anyway. The current colorways are a bit goofy IMO but will definitely buy some again when others roll out.True to size. Comfortable and stylish.I was a little hesitant with the price tag. But they are extremely comfortable and help get me through my 8-9 hour work day on my feet. They actually have a lot of support and provide maximum comfort.These are awesome Vans shoes! The support was more than expected and the cushioning was great! I\\'ve used them to walk all around BostonMy new every day shoe for work. I wore the OG ultra ranges and after needing something with a bit more cushion I have found THE ONE.Super comfortable and look great. I\\'ve gotten compliments already. The materials seem higher quality than the Ultrarange EXO and are well made. I will buy againThe first time I used this shoe It was raining a little bit, the red color faded and stained all my shoe! How it\\'s possible that? So poor qualityThis shoe cam out amazing. Not only does it have beloved characters, but they aren\\'t printed on its and actual embroidery.GreatThese shoes are great. The color and fit are excellent.The color is cool, as some have already written, it is different from what is shown on the site, I would say that it is gray, but in my case it does not matter.\\nP.S.\\nI will attach a photo so that you can see what the color really isMy wife loves these!Started wearing Van\\'s back in the skating days (early 80\\'s), still wearing them!  Today they are a rich icon of the glory days of the past, however I do skate some and always wear Van\\'s when doing so!  This version of the Sk8-Hi is a tapered version of the original shoe.  Basically much less padding around the ankle area, you can liken the shoe to a Converse Hi Top but seem like they have better quality.  The Van\\'s seem to be a bit wider and just fit better than the Converse Hi Top for my feet.  Something to note though I usually wear Van\\'s with and without socks but mostly without.  I find the canvas on the hi-top part a bit rough on the ankles until the material is well broken in.  With this said, short ankle socks work great with the tapered style and can barley be seen at the top of the shoe.  Also the tapered version of the Sk8-Hi is a bit cooler in the summer due to the canvas upper as opposed to the standard version.  I find that the standard version of this shoe can almost never be worn without socks but this version you can wear sockless if you wish.  Overall this is a really cool shoe (literally) and if you are looking for a close Converse feel this is the one to get, only better!  They fit true to size for my size 9.5 feet and a tad wider than Converse.  As always Zappos does a great job and have never had any issues with them or the products I purchase.  Thanks Zappos!Red fabric bled into white areas.The fit and size is exactly as I figured (NICE / After all they are VANS). Really like the Tapered style. I\\'m not a skater, however I ride motorcycles and they work well for support and traction when my feet are down. Highly recommend this style Van for the summer season riding, \\n(you won\\'t be disappointed). They could use a bit more cushion on the bottom for us older folks that have become loyal to the Vans for MC riding. That\\'s not a deal breaker for me.GreatI love vans and have worn them since the 90’s. I wanted these for the summer, that are adorable!!! Some reviews said they ran big but that is not true, I am consistently a 7.5 in every shape and style of vans.I was incredibly excited to get these Vejas and give them a try...seeing them everywhere in IG and in cities.  I wear a women\\'s 11, since hard to find Vejas in a women\\'s 42 I opted to try the unisex/men\\'s in a 42.  Super cute out of the box but they are VERY stiff and HARD on the insole/inside.  They felt very clunky and not comfy.  I had read took a bit to break them in but on my smaller foot I immediately felt the shoe rubbing my left big toe.  I wear a medium width and do not have wide feet, so opted to send these back.  Think I am sticking to my onitsukus....found these shoes to be incredibly uncomfortable.I\\'m kind of surprised by the less than positive reviews I see on this site for the V-12. I almost didn\\'t order them because of that, but I\\'m so glad that I did. Right up front, these are a great looking pair of shoes. I purchased the all white leather. They are a little stiff at first, but I wore them around the house for about an hour and they felt really good after that. The leather is of great quality and it\\'s real full grain leather. Not the bonded leather that you find these days on the overpriced swoosh sneakers. The sole is legit rubber, like you would expect in a high quality shoe (not synthetic) and the materials are stitched, not glued. There is not a lot of arch support, but it will probably be adequate for most. They do have a removable insole. I guess if you have a wide foot, these might not be for you, but for my average width foot, I found these extremely well fitted. I wear a 13 in most athletic sneakers and a 12 in dress shoes. I bought these in a 12 (EU 46) and they fit great. with room in the toe box.Great looking and comfortable - the shoelace broke while trying on but a great sneaker.These fit perfectly !   I absolutely loved them.If you are between sizes like I am then both sizes won’t fit well enough to wear without an insert when you go with the bigger size. The tongue is stiff but after wearing around the house for a day it was fine. Definitely cute but just don’t fit quite right but I’m keeping them and just using an insert, wish there were in between sizes!You can see the foam in the tongue of the shoe  - it looks very unfinishedThey\\'re very stylish. Keep them clean and you\\'re get loads of compliments. I wear a 10.5-11 typically, and this shoe (10.5) fits my foot absolutely perfectly. I\\'ve never worn a shoe that has such a perfect balance of snug / comfortable, until now. Considerable amount of cushion while walking, makes long days easier. Very nice indeed.These shoes were super comfortable. But, what I did not see in the pictures as I was ordering them is the visible foam at the top of the shoe’s tongue. It made the shoe look unfinished and cheap. Why didn’t they close that seam to hide the inner foam?? Sent them back for that reason alone.Ugh! the unfinished foam is terrible. Looks terrible - not trendy. These had to go backI love New Balances and I am here to say: DO NOT buy these. They have no support, the soles are super hard, they are very narrow, especially for New Balances. No idea why NB made these instead of something that looks similar and actually has a comfortable sole.I got these because they are a fun color and I hoped they\\'d be comfortable on my right foot (sore tendon) and left foot (sore toe). They far exceeded my expectations for both looks and comfort. I was concerned that the fit would be off since they are unisex sizing, but not so. I wear an 8.5 M in athletic-type shoes, and a men\\'s 7 fit me perfectly. They are not too wide--just right!a lil long and the insole feels like jello but after swapping the insoles they feel great. good boardfeel and super durableThese shoes have a classic, attractive design, but the so-called \"leather\" feels rubbery and has a white bright finish that detracts from their appeal.These are very comfortable shoes. I am glad that they are making them again. As a whole I have not been impressed with the new generation of Keen shoes, but these are an exception. About half a size larger than marked, enough for thick socks. They provide great support and plenty of width throughout. So far they are quite durable.These shoes are fantastic. I\\'m 6\\'6\" 250lbs. and I love walking, so I put my shoes through some pretty rugged paces. The banks of the James River in Richmond, VA offer miles of rugged but walkable trails and I\\'m on them every day. The Keen Brixen Lo stays snugly on my foot and has the perfect lug pattern for maximum grip with minimum mud retention. They are waterproof and insulated but do not feel hot on my feet in warmer weather. I usually wear 11.5-12 depending on the shoe, so I ordered 11.5 but returned them for the 12. I love them and will definitely buy another pair if these ever wear out!These are warm and comfortable shoes! The floor in my office is cold. Walks on cold days, my feet got cold. In the past I have worn heavily insulated boots to keep my feet warm in the winter. This year I thought I would try lower cut insulated shoes. Unlike many other shoes that I have tried, these shoes with wool socks my feet have stayed warmer. The low tops allow the sweat in my socks to corporate. There is lots of room around the toes for evaporation. I use a Dr. Scholls gel foot pad under the shoe pad. They did take a while to break in but are comfortable now after about two weeks. They are great on ice and light snow. I order one size larger for the foot pads. I am very happy with this purchase. Thanks, Zappos.These shoes fit me so well that I had to purchase a second pair in the brown color. I have sensitive feet where the bottoms of my foot feel like every step is on hard cement and have found that shoes with EVA Midsoles seem to help. Just do a Zappos search on EVA Midsole and you will find all shoes that have this material. The material is commonly used to manufacture flip-flops as it is soft without being sponge like. I hope this helps other customers with sensitive feet.Awesome design! Great traction in winter! Keen Dry works well. Easy on and off! That is why I bought them, and they didn\\'t disappoint! These are bullet proof and would highly recommend them!Cute sneaker but this European 37 fits more like US 6.5 and not a true 6. So this is too large for me and no euro 36 available.  If you are a US 6.5 you’d likely be happy with what is called a women’s 6/37 for this sneaker brand.This shoe is attractive and is the perfect casual sneaker to wear with a variety of outfits.  The fit was comfortable as soon as I put it on and it did not cause heel slippage which is often a problem for me with my narrow heel.The toe is narrow so I will exchange for the size 8.  They are really nice and very cute though so even though they have NO support I will get another pair.Second pair of this brand and style.  Like the fit, support and weight of shoe.  I wear a 8.5 or 9 but a 39 (Size 8) in these shoes as the 40 (Size 9) was too large.I had these before so these are replacement. They look cool and are quite comfortable for me. I have bunions and these have worked well!They are very comfortable, no stiffness, great color and construction. I ordered the other color before they are all gone. Very happy with them.]I have not worn converse for years, only sketchers, and I am so glad I went back to a more normal balance without all of the extra padding. The high top also offers more support for my ankles.Zappos is the best company onlineThese have the classis Converse Chuck Taylor All Star look in a supple and sturdy taupe leather. While the insole is cushier than gym shoes back in the day, it doesn\\'t provide the shaped support I\\'ve come to expect in even casual sneakers. The style is also rather long and narrow, not a great match for my short, wide feet. I\\'m returning them, but I\\'m confident they will be a great shoe for the right person.These offer a classic look in a taupe leather that is both supple and sturdy. The insole is far cushier than gym shoes were back in the day, but my vintage feet have grown accustomed to more supportive shoes. I think the Converse Chuck Taylor All Stars were always a long narrow shoe that call to mind wiry basketball players of yore. In a size that accommodates my rather wide feet, they definitely make my feet look significantly longer than my favorite casual sneakers and walking shoes do. I fear I have outgrown the look and feel of these American originals. I\\'m returning them so someone who appreciates a timeless look and still has feet, knees and ankles that can withstand the jarring a a long walk in these would likely deliver can enjoy them.Nice you like to slip in feature better than I thought I wouldto walkGood looking shoes that can be worn casually or dress casualLove these sneakers. Will buy another pair in different color.Every dayThese were my first pair shoes from DC. These shoes are very comfortable. The material they are made from feels nice, they fit very well, and I love how they look. I was very surprised when they came to my house in two days. I would recommend buying these shoes and to buy from Zappos. Can\\'t beat the free shipping.DC Pures fall apart - \\nThis is a replacement pair. I have to exchange the first pair because the sole was separating from the shoe. Now the replacement pair is two-weeks-old and starting to do the same thing in the same place. I would not order this shoe again. The Zappos customer service has been wonderful.\\nThank you.They feel great, and look good. First time ordering this variant of DC shoes they feel sturdy and comfortable I\\'m sure they will last me as long as previous pairs... which is quite awhile!I love these shoes so much that I\\'ve bought 4 pairs now. Super comfortable.Zappos is great! We found the perfect shoe in the perfect size 14 (hard to find)! The ordering process was very easy and we had the shoes in a few days. Great experience!Excellent very comfortable shoe. Really great support and sizing.Bought these to wear on a trip to Italy where I needed something comfortable for long days but also a bit more dressed up than sneakers. These are great and my only gripe is my heel doesn’t feel entirely secure even with the laces pretty tight.Fits well.  Feels very durable.  Grips the ground very well.lugged shoe can take a bit of getting used to -- be careful going down the stairs! but generally great.Needed ladies not men’sI was pleasantly surprised when I discovered that Skechers offered a shoe that was waterproof and came in extra wide. Getting this combination in the past has been difficult.these will be for use when the bad weather goes away in the springOn my daily 5 mile walks they do the jobStrange feel as your walking, almost like your foot sits sideways/inwards as you step, awkward & uncomfortable but everything else felt good & great colors, wish it worked!Just too small for meThe canvas is too stiff.   It broke weird over my toes so it hurt to walk around.  Too bad, super cute.shoe was great until it ripped after the 5th wearBeen loving mine for three years now. Yes the tongue part was kind of stiff at first but I slid it a little to the side, where it still sits today, and it feels just fine.  Very supportive shoe (my orthopedic surgeon approves…).   Have no idea why the other reviewer says they fell apart.  Hard to imagine how this sturdy leather shoe could possibly ever do that.  Mine have been worn like crazy and I don’t see that ever happening.  Nice leather.  I really like the Esplar model.  It’s a little lower and less chunky.  The company story is very compelling too, read it and see how cool this shoe brand is.  They don’t spend money on advertising and they pay what they think is a fair price for their raw materials so that their suppliers are fairly compensated.Not exactly white. More like an ivory. Love the style, but not the color. Returned them and still looking .I bought these for my husband and he really loved them. I bought them in the dark blue and black and the fit was so comfortable and true to size. Of course this brand is wonderful quality and the price point was too great to pass up. Let’s all support Zappos and retail business in this hard time. Remember how the customer service people are all working from home, so let’s keep the business alive!I’m glad I read the reviews before I ordered, and went with a half size smaller.  Fits perfect, very light weight, I can’t wait to wear them out!Shoe was very large in all areas, too tall, too wide, and too long. I wear 11 in everything and 10.5 was quite large. As another reviewer commented, if you try to tighten up the laces the top of the shoe wrinkles and looks horrible since they did not make the tongue a separate piece.If you’re 10.5 order 10 with Cole Haan.  That was my experience with multiple pairs.  Or I’m not a 10.5.  Sometimes I am though.Too big need to exchange for a smaller size, it runs bigSuper cute, love the red and blue detail. Very soft and flexible, not too heavy of a shoe. Footbed is a little flat for me, so I might pop in some inserts. But they are comfortable and fun!The shoes are great right out of the box. Any discomfort or feeling of fatigue is the fault of my feet ...they have issues. The shoes are stylish and well made. I actually ordered 2 more pairs just like these so I could rotate them and keep them fresh.Large and clunky. Left one squeaks when walking.Very comfortable and durable shoes, bought one more pairGood priceShoes look and feel awesome, took advantage of another great offer from Zappos.I buy all my shoes online and wear a size 9. This shoe felt super tight. Make sure you order at least a half size larger when ordering this shoe!When I first got these shoes I loved them - simple look, very comfortable (the insoles are great)...just an all around great shoe. However, after time the shoe has started falling apart. The fabric is literally fraying and coming undone, and in parts the fabric is separating from the sole of the shoe. I have had these shoes for less than a year. I don\\'t skate, these shoes are used to walk around NYC - nothing too taxing. I\\'m currently looking for another pair of shoes and I just bought these about six or seven months ago. If these shoes would last longer than a year I would endorse them, but, as it stands, I cannot recommend buying them.The shoes are great, confortable and easy to wear.\\nThey warmn and also well ventilated for long walks.I bought these as a gift for my 26 year old son. He loved them! And, they arrived on my doorstep the day after I ordered them.The shoes came in 2 days. We were so surprised. Unfortunately, they were too big, but we were able to return them with the shipping paid. We reordered a smaller size, and they also came in 2 days. Great service! The Etnies are great shoes, as always. Very nice-looking.Good looking shoe. Very comfortable, wore them walking around Disney for a day. BIG PROBLEM, they get a bad odor after wearing them for 1 day if you don’t wear socks. Other slip-on shoes like Cole Haan have a leather insert so they don’t smell. It’s unfortunate these don’t have some anti-smell feature as they are cool shoes.This is a follow-up/long-term review, six months after my initial review. These shoes continue to amaze me with their comfort, versatility, and durability. I have worn them literally hundreds of times, including light hiking, golf, yard work, and general kicking around. I have machine washed them about ten times, and through it all, they show virtually no signs of wear. No tears or un-stitching on the uppers and the soles have very little wear. The fit is as good as the day I bought them. Simply a really great shoe!!!Great shoe but the picture of the Night color led me to believe it was charcoal. It is in fact a true navy blue.I\\'ve cycled through so many black shoes trying to find the right pair for work, the search has finally stopped after years! I absolutely love these shoes. Extremely lightweight, very breathable which is nice during my 10 hour shifts. You honestly forget about your feet when wearing these, in a good way, nothing rubs, feet down hurt after a few hours, simply a wonderful shoe. I\\'m not typically a fan of all black shoes, in the past my black shoes have only been worn for work. But since I got these I find myself wearing them 90% of the time I\\'m not at work, because they\\'re just that great! I\\'m actually ordering two more pair now in different colors. You won\\'t regret these guys!These are great kickin\\' around shoes. I have flat feet so the very moderate arch is a lot better than some of the other shoes I\\'ve tried. These are super comfortable. The size is good and the the shoes \"breathe\" well. The cushioning is good and comfortable for wearing all day. The only downside is that they aren\\'t truly slip on like some boat shoes. If you want the heel support you\\'ll have to slip them on with your hands. The heel collapses and you can wear these like clogs but I\\'m not into clogs.\\nOverall -- a great shoe.Normally wear a 10.5. Had to order a 10. They fit fine, but they did not run the padding on the tongue all the way to the end so it is is quite stiff and irritates the top of my foot with a normal sock on.Fit is true -Comfort is very good. Stylish can be dressed up or down. I love them.Fit was great.  Wide widths are often hard to find.  After break in comfort should be fine.  Pretty stiff at first.I wear a 10 in sneakers. These fit perfect. Very comfortable.Good style, comfortable, easy to wear dressed up or down.True to size (womens 11.5), comfortable and even cuter than the picture.  Love these.Excellent sneakerWhile the Keds feel and fit well, the workmanship and/or quality control is not as good as I wanted it. The eyelets aren\\'t aligned well and end up crooked. This leaves the bottom edge and two eyelets near the toe, appear crooked. Pertaining to quality control, this is not the first time. My last sneaker order was for Converse Allstars and the same thing happened. Zappos should be able to do better. I could have returned the orders but there is no guarantee that it wouldn\\'t happen again because it is quite evident that no one is actually checking the product before it ships.Love these shoes I wear a size 15 so finding comfortable shoes in my size is challenging but I love the selection of shoes here.  Also wide feet so these court graffik DC shoes are great some of the other styles like the DC pure seem a little narrow and less comfortable for those with wide feet.Great pair of shoes that look even better than the pictures. My son says they’re filthy sick which I understand is a good thing.Love them they fit fantasticDC make good shoes, always satisfied.I love them so much, worth itFantastic gym shoe!I\\'ve had these shoes for a few weeks and they are very comfortable while at the gym. #sweepstakesI haven\\'t bought Reebok shoes for a while. \\nI liked the look online, after buying i am impressed.\\nThe quality of the shoe is great. I found the comfort out weighs the look. Out of the box I found the shoes to be very comfortable.It fits greatGreat fit, and I love the look of the shoe. Very happy with my purchase.I got mine in Carbon/Battleship and they were just what I expected! Having said that I think we need a disclaimer that states these types of shoes are not made exclusively for \"skaters\". I am one of the many people who wear what they want and what they like, and it just so happens to be \"skater shoes\". And it\\'s not hard to understand why...the Court Graffik has a nice clean style and the shoes are comfortable. So if there is anyone out there who is his own person and wants to sport a stylish and comfortable shoe, you can\\'t go wrong with the Court Graffik.Good shoe! Although, it took me 3 tries to get the right size. the shoe would be perfect, but the length wouldn\\'t be right. Oh well, When I got them they were awesome! Nice padding (I bike to school, skateboard etc.). The point is good quality. I use them a lot. I\\'m 13 size 8.0. Awesome shoes, these will last me until I\\'m a size 9. Then I\\'ll get another pair. I got wide feet.I\\'ve been wearing these shoes for the better part of a decade, and until recently they had been the best shoes I had ever worn. This year, however, I\\'ve been through two pairs of these shoes; the first pair lasted five months and the second lasted only four months. Up until recently I could count on these shoes lasting a year or better! I will not be buying DC shoes again!Zappos is the only place that I can find DC\\'s in size 15. I love the prices and the shipping is very quick. I can\\'t say enough good things!Very comfortable.  I got them in white, Clean and crisp white shoes will get noticed.  Zappos shipped them to me even faster than normal, I am very happy with the service.  Final word, extremely comfortable shoes that look great, but I would only recommend them if you plan to clean and take care of them.I normally wear an 11W and have a longer second toe. The arch support is perfect and the shoe fits my high instep (top of my foot) perfectly, as if it were made for people with high insteps. However I found these to be narrow in width and uncomfortable on my toes due to how they narrow to a taper at the toes. My toes are both pressed together and almost touching the inside of the top of the shoe, which feels awful when it is hot outside and my feet are sweating. The material is also somewhat slippery feeling overal, which can be a bit of a mental block to putting them on without socks. The shoes do not fall off while walking, which is a plus, but I will only wind up using these for quick trips to the mailbox.I absolutely love these shoes!! I am a woman and wear a size 12 shoe and alway have a hard time finding cute shoes. Granted these are men’s but these could easily be unisex. I bought them for my trip to Europe in the fall and I can’t wait sport them with my skinny jeans and dresses! Like I said I wear a 12 in women’s and the 11 in men’s is perfect. The width was perfect and it has good arch support with a cushy foot bed. I use to wear adidas in the 90s and I’m proud to wear them again!!!They fit so well. I\\'m a 10 in Women and ordered an 8 in men. They\\'re so so soft and comfortable; I wore them to work and I do a lot of walking.Ordered men’s size 12 US but were too big. Downsized to 11 and they fit perfectly and look amazing.Comfortable sneakers, look great, perfect fit. Apparently my review needs to be 50 characters long before I can submit it, but unfortunately I am a man of few words. Suffice to say, I think these kicks are pretty neat.Quality materials that took him back to his youth in the 70s and early 80s.Bought these for my husband for his biannual shoe replacement and he really likes them. We tried two different models from Peter Millar and these were the ones we both liked. He said he can tell they\\'re expensive because they feel very comfy. He\\'s an 11.5 or 12 and we had to go with the 12.Wow! More comfortable than expected. And they look better too than from the photos. Glad I ordered them. Thanks Zappos!Loved these sneakers and they are my second pair. I can wear them to work which is wonderful. I highly recommend. The quality is classic Peter Millar. Top of the line.  Worth the price.comfprtable and looks greatThis shoe definitely fits true to size. It is light in weight and well crafted. Great shoe!!Was really excited to purchase these shoes for those casual work outfit days. Have worn total of two days and already showing excessive wear and tear. They look as though I have a problem where I drag my feet. I don’t. I wish someone would have mentioned this before I spent my money. Steve Madden, in the past, hadn’t let me down. With these shoes I believe I won’t be giving them my money for sub-par products.I typically wear a 12, so I bought a 12. WAY too long, so tried the 11 1/2, still had a thumb between toe and front of shoe. Would try 11, but already the 11 1/2 feels harrow, so I know it won\\'t work out. Will be returning for another shoe.The shoes fit pretty well, although they run a touch long. I got a size 12 and the tip of the toe extends a little further than I expected, but the shoe doesn\\'t feel big. I\\'d keep them if it was just about fit and looks (which I like).\\nI\\'m surprised that nobody has mentioned that the soles of these shoes are not rubber, and seem to be like a recycled plastic or fiber material that has zero grip. I put these on and walked around my living room, which has hardwood floors, and I felt like I was walking on ice. My feet were slipping all over the place! I feel like these would be dangerous on linoleum, in grocery stores, and on wet tile. They look like a boat shoe, but I wouldn\\'t? wear them anywhere near water. Returned.My 28 year old son has a hard time finding size 17 shoes that are cool enough and comfortable. He loves this pair!THe look and comfort are PERFECT. I love these SO much. Unfortunately the quality is lower than expected for Steve Maddens. The eyelets of each pair I got have been damaged and shredded the laces. Just something to be aware of when purchasing. Otherwise, 10/10 would GLADLY recommend!Fits good.   Looks good.   Mostly for walking aroundPurchased for my father. Despite being a Wide width, this was still way too narrow for him. Other brands Wide fit him well. This style is just too narrow.I ordered four pairs of Cliftons since I\\'ve worn them for years.  So far, this is the only pair I plan to keep.  After rehabbing from ankle surgery last year, I\\'m finally able to wear shoes again and can walk normally.  I absolutely LOVE this shoe!  It\\'s wide enough for my feet and has a nice big toe box in addition to having a normal tongue that is not tethered to the base of the shoe.  I\\'m finding that the shoes that have the tongue tethered to the base of the shoe by a stretchy mesh is too tight around the middle of my foot and causes pain after a couple of hours of wearing.  I hope you\\'ll continue to make shoes that are not tongue-tied!These shoes are a game changer.  Having always been an avid walker, I have had one hip replacement and need another in order to get moving the distances I desire.  My physical therapist recommended these to help me through the reconditioning phase as I prepare for my next surgery and for my future needs.  They have made a huge difference in my comfort level and ability to walk longer distances with much less pain.  I highly recommend them for these purposes and also to help prevent wear and tear on joints if you are young and healthy.  I am a fan for life!Please design more options for casual business attire.I wear wide sized shoes.  I loved the style of these shoes so I thought I would try a pair even though it didn\\'t come in wide.  Unfortunately they didn\\'t fit my wide feet and I had to return them.  I wish Hoka had more wide options.  I\\'d buy several more pairs.I purchased a suede variety of shoe. I took a risk knowing that it didn\\'t come in a wide size option. The risk failed. The only negative comment I would make about this product is we need more wide size options available.This is my new favorite shoe. I have it in three different styles. Super comfortable and durable. Just came back from a European vacation with loads of walking and hiking and I don\\'t know what I would\\'ve done without these shoes.Can\\'t go wrong with this classic! I\\'ve been wearing these Reebok classic sneakers for over 10 years. This is one of the most comfortable sneakers ever made and it\\'s light. They also are very durable and won\\'t fall apart like the expensive sneakers. Don\\'t be fooled by the low price because these sneakers are better than a lot of those expensive sneakers. Just don\\'t get any deep stains in the suede and they will look great because stains are always difficult to get out of suede.I love the classic look of this shoe.  Casual, comfortable, and doesn\\'t stand out too much.  My shoes came with two sets of laces (gray and black) so that you could pick which color  you wanted.  The size does seem to run small.  I always wear size 13 in all shoes and have never had an issue with sizes, but this shoe felt more like a size 12.Great shoe! Good standing for work shoe.These are the bomb! Me\\'ese Brother David is stuck in the 1970\\'s. He will wear these shoes until they have no sole left! He love them. Thank you so much for having them. Little things like this make a great company! Job well done! Woof Woof!I hadn\\'t tried slip-ins before and I have pros and cons about them. I do like the slip-in ability, however, they can also slip out easily too. I normally wear a 10.5 but had to get a 10 in these shoes. When walking in a crowd, I have had people accidentally step on my feet and the show came off.  When walking down a hill or steps, my toes feel like they\\'re getting smashed against the front. I do have an old pair of Skechers that are a pull-on style, and I would prefer that since it\\'s still easy to put your shoes on, but you have the smugness of a real shoe around your foot. Unfortunately, it seems like the majority of shoes being offered are now slip-ins. \\n\\nThe major pro is I wore these shoes soon after buying them to a 3-week trip in Europe and did a LOT of walking, more so than usual. During those 3 weeks, I never had an issue with my feet being sore and the arch fit was excellent. I would prefer the non-slip-in style, but I will be buying another pair of these shoes in a different color.Just too wide in D size. Sorry. Returning both pair. Love the look , style and color. Just too wide for my foot.This shoe is just too massive. The D width is too wide for my foot. Like the look, not the overall size.I returned this product due to arch fit.  I have purchased another style of Skechers to replace.Too wide even if I did not purchase the wide sizeI love these shoes. My fault for ordering the wrong size. I got the right size and they\\'re very comfortable. Look great.Overall these shoes were too narrow and hurt my feet. They also run very small. I normally wear an 11.5 but had to get a 10.5 to make these work. Unfortunately the shoes run very narrow and I couldn’t make them work :(  too bad since they have a really great aesthetic. \\n\\nHats off to the amazing customer service at Zappos!PerfectTrue to fit and size. Slightly snug at first around tongue area. Relaxes after first wearingGreat shoes.  Very comfortable.I have wide feet and bought the wide size and had good room in the toe box area.  The shoes are very comfortable to walk in right out of the box.  There\\'s some nice squish when walking yet still supportive.  I would recommend a wool sock for odor/moisture management because these shoes don\\'t really breathe and I was wearing them in moderate temperatures.  I\\'m over 50, carrying a few more pounds than I should but my knees and back felt good wearing these shoes after a day of moving my kid out her downtown Chicago dorm.Really overpriced shoe given the materials. The soles are cushioned well but very susceptible to wear; the rubber is already peeling. There is a crack around where the foot bends in the front. The lack of well-engineered eyelets means that those will tear, too. I find them a bit tight also.Really like the fit, style and quality. Great for casual wear, dress-up and everyday wear. Extremely comfortable, with great support. Based on reviews, I sized down from 12 to 11 1/2 - perfect fit. Number of compliments in group gatherings.These felt great right away. Not always a fan of Cole Haan, but these are keepers.Great looking, long lasting shoe!Great option!I like the shoe very much, it’s very comfortable and stylish.Chuck Time So Stylish and timelessChucks are Chucks but these have a fancy cover on themI feel very confident when I wear these shoes I LOVE THEM! As a 20 year old, I don\\'t think I\\'m too old to rock velcro. They\\'re unique and easy to throw on with a comfy outfit or casually cute outfit. Very versatile!These are another Awesome Leather Shoe From Vans ! Been wearing Vans since 1973, growing up in Virginia Beach, most friends skate, surf, and party. \\nNow especially with the Comfy Coush, Vans has added a whole new line of incredibly comfortable shoes.\\nPEACE !Absolutely loved it! I’m a 20 year old girl but I can still rock Velcro!my low functioning autistic daughter is able to put these on so much more easily now! highly recommend!These were purchased for my handicapped brother all he wanted were these shoes. He only has use of one hand and he says now he can put on his own shoes and he loves them so will be getting him another pair!I\\'m comparing these the to the Puma Suede Classic pre XXI.  When I couldn\\'t find any of the regular classics, I thought I\\'d try these as they look similar.\\nUnfortunately I don\\'t like the fit as much. Less arch support and overall not as comfortable. The \"Suede\" looks cheaper as well. \\nIf you are used to the Puma Suede Classics that have been around for years, be prepared for some changes.Narrow---could not wear socks unless very thin.  No wide available, so returned.  But a great shoe--nice look and material.Love everything about these shoes!! Style, fit and quality all first rate.Be specific about your likes and dislikes. How was the fit and size? What does the material feel like? How awesome (or not) do you feel wearing them?Well it\\'s listed as a men\\'s shoe, so I ordered my size in men\\'s 6.5 and I was sent a woman\\'s 6.5.  Other than that I rock old school pumas all the time.Bought these for my husband and after just 3 months the stitching at the top split on both shoes!  Not up to par whatsoever!These look good as an around the house slipper/slide when you fold down the heel or if you want to pair them with jeans for a casual look.  Very happy with my purchase.These are very comfortable, cool, and versatile. You can wear them as regular slip on shoes or fold the back down and just walk into them. I do agree with other posts that they do fit a size large though. I would recommend these shoes and have been thinking of buying another color.Awesome, shoe. As a doctor, I wear them to work and to the beach. Going for a black pair next. Order them one full size smaller.Awesome shoes, they are truly mesh uppers, nice and cool, in the summer heat. Good arch support. Heed the review comments that they run a size large, it\\'s true! I didn\\'t and had to exchange mine.I got these because my last pair of Skechers were absolutely coming apart. And I am very happy so far with these. Only been about a week but they are very comfortable and easy to put on and take off. I love there is no tying necessary. And believe these were a decent value. I got 2 years out of my last pair, and think these may outlast them.Always count on you.This shoe fits great and is very comfortable. I have Neuropathy in my feet and need very soft soles and interior padding. I already bought a second pair!I use these shoes for everyday wear - walking etc.  These shoes have laces but not the kind you can use to tighten the fit.  My right heel slips as I walk but not so much I would return them.I had to tighten it for the width, and add my own arch supports (as I do with all the shoes I buy). Then it felt great and lasted a year with walking an average of three miles per day.Great women’s wide sneaker, just add orthotics.  The grey color way is gorgeous, and the quality is excellent. Like other shoes of this type, they have no arch support, but work well with orthotics.  Sole is not too thin, not too clunky.  Love!The quality of the leather upper is poor. It\\'s very stiff and I had to double check if it was even genuine leather. The quality did not match the price point.I love these better than AF1s and 550s. The leather is amazing and the soles are comfortable. Worth it!!okComfortable and nice lookLooked like a floppy boat…I have been wearing this Superga nappa leather 2750 style for years now, and I love the look with all kinds of casual outfits, and even dresses!  They have a more substantial, thicker sole than many competitor brands of this type of sneaker, and the leather is of nice quality.  I do insert over-the-counter orthotics for added arch support which makes them even more comfortable to wear all day, every day.Love these shoes. I have Reeboks for running, for training and for styling.  Been buying them for a couple of decades. I\\'m an old fart.PerfectI have so many pairs of reeboks, it\\'s honestly the most comfortable shoe I\\'ve bought! After my first pair in 2018 I haven\\'t wore or bought anything else besides Reebok! #SweepstakesComfy and reliable white shoes. A little slippery at first but so great when broken in #sweepstakesSuper comfortable shoes. True to size. Look amazingLooks good, has a great heel cup to lock your foot in. Fits my orthotics great, but I would say it\\'s about a half size large. I wear an 11.5 in the NB 255 and went down to an 11 in the 272Very comfortable and stylish shoe. I have a wide foot and surprisingly was not too narrow. I went a half size down from what I usually get.I wear this shoe with Khakis with a casual button down or jeans and a polo. This shoe is versatile, comfortable and looks good on your foot.This shoe looks amazing and is very comfortable. It has great board feel and doesn\\'t feel as cumbersome as other thick skateshoes. I found they do run pretty big, possibly because of the wider forefoot. I normally wear a sz 9.5 and I had to exchange for a 9. They are a little stiff out the box, but after a few skate sessions, I\\'m sure they\\'ll soften up.Worn the shoes for a couple weeks, and the sole of the shoe is already falling apart.They were comfortableUnfortunately the size was a surprise. I had ordered an 11.5 W, which is 1/2 size larger than what I normally wear because of a troublesome toe that had been broken years ago. The 11.5 was still too tight and I was hoping for a little wiggle room.The fit is only okay and the arch support is minimal. It\\'s just not the most comfortable shoe in my view. I have to say I don\\'t think I would order it again--particularly for the price. It\\'s too much IMHO.Love this shoe.  It is comfortable and light and yet looks nicer than your typical tennis shoe or sneaker.  It works great with shorts or casual pants.  Really happy with this purchase.  My foot is a little wide, but not wide enough to need a wide shoe.  This is comfortable so it is a generous width.They ran a little large, but not enough to exchange them. I’ve found the same issues with other OluKai styles.I was eyeing these for a few months. Glad I pulled the trigger. They arrived in under 24 hours! Insane. Haven’t put on another pair since these arrived.This style is great. I have the green and light grey. I have used it for hikes and casual wear for over a month and keeps me comfortable every time...and looks great no matter what.Hell yah 5 star\\nBut wish they had that washable sauce\\nWish I could wash them hos off\\n2-3 times imma toss em out \\n\\nDon\\'t be expecting\\n12 months\\nOf the shoes \\n3 way too much \\n\\nAnd you stupid if you don\\'t\\nPick em up for a hundred bucks \\nImma pick these playas up \\nOne bill I ain\\'t no punk \\n\\nBc like em...\\nAnd I\\'ll barely put em in the wash \\nCause you not ready for the sauce \\nDon\\'t expect too much bc you lost \\n\\nIf you got a bill scoop then. If not don\\'t!I normally wear a 9.  Ordered an 8.5 because I remember that this brand runs large.  Turns out that an 8.5 was still to big so I had to return them and exchange for an 8.  They now fit great.My father-in-law likes this pair of shoes. He is in his later 70s and has several issues with his feet, a swollen toe, nerve pains, etc. It is extremely difficult to find shoes for him. He seems like this pair of shoes and wear them when he goes out. The mesh fabric is breatheable and they look nice too. I would recommend to others!Was looking for something with style for my Dad with diabetic feet. A slip on. Mesh. He tried them on and they were a dream. He wears them all the time.   He\\'s 90. He\\'s happy.LOve the shoe. Normally wear a 10.5. Ordered 10 and perfect. I had read reviews about a little big. \\nHave several OluKaiVery trendy! I get a lot of compliments and the shoes match with many outfits. The right amount of “old school” while still being very comfortable. Not bulky looking either. Shoe fits true to size.These shoes are fantastic! New Balance always walks the line of clunky and/or ugly, but these are the right amount of “Dad shoe” with just enough modern design to make them feel cool. The neon green pops, the sole is firm but cushy, and overall it is a great all day sneaker. I am a consistent 12 in all other sneakers but having worn New Balance in the past I sized down a half size and they fit perfectly.I’m happy with the purchase although I thought the color was more red than the orange it turned out to be.The fit, style and support are really good and the quality is apparent as well.I just got these and have worn them only once, and I received compliments on them all day! I like the little wood-looking details, which are interesting without looking too quirky or cute. I did quite a bit of walking on my commute and then around campus, and they were very comfortable all day.Great shoes. Very nice look. Very comfortable. Not at all disappointed.I love these shoes. I find them to be the most comfortable and versatile slip-ons I\\'ve ever owned. But Native should make it clear that these are not sustainable with daily wear. I purchased these shoes from Zappos on May 12, 2019 for dog walking and commuting. Exactly two months to the day of purchase, the soles have worn through to the bottom of my feet. I wish I could justify buying a pair every two months, but for $45, there\\'s no way. So bummed out.Bottom line? I would not recommend as an everyday pair. I bought these for work where I am on my feet all day running around a warehouse. They are light, breathable, and I was sold on the anti-microbial properties of the shoe which combined with the light materials and airy, breathable upper; leaving my feet feeling way, way better at the end of the day. In regards to wear: I noticed creases started after my first full shift at work, which isn\\'t a lot of great feats of athleticism but is a lot of walking. I also have been wearing these out and about as a test. They don\\'t seem to like getting wet and are not very durable outside of room operating temperature (i.e. too hot, too cold). Comfort: They\\'re pretty comfy. They\\'re also not going to fall off your feet (I literally have ran across a warehouse leaping over boxes with no slip), and have great traction. However, do not confuse these with non slip treads that ARE designed for oil slick and slippery surfaces. If you\\'re going to buy a pair for work in the freight or logistics biz, they\\'re cheap, light, comfy, and the only downside I can think of is they may only live four to five months with everyday work day use. If you\\'re buying them for the town, they\\'re stylish, but keep in mind that while I feel they\\'re true to fit, the toe thing gives it an extra half size of length. I\\'ve been wearing these two weeks and almost trip daily wearing these not picking me feet up far enough for the toe thing to clear the ground.I\\'m a women\\'s size 7.5 and the mens 6/womens 8 is huge! the mens 5/womens 7 is still pretty big. I\\'m going to try the mens 5/womens 6 next and post an update. Size down ladies!These are so much cuter than Crocs...they look sort of like slip-on Converse sneakers, but are made of Croc-like foamy plastic. Great summer slip on shoe, sturdier than flip flops. Seem a tiny bit narrow, but are comfy and a great value.Bought these for my husband for when he does light yard work. He likes them because they\\'re light-weight and can be easily rinsed off.I\\'ve been buying these shoes for decades.    I don\\'t run anymore, but the shoes are still very comfortable.   My relationship with these Saucony shoes has lasted much longer than many marriages,OUTSTANDIND SHOE THAT PROVIDED QUALITYY, COMFORT, AND ESTHETICS AT A REASONABLE PRICE.  I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS SHOE.Exactly what I ordered.Wish they made this shoe in a D width. It’s got good heel support and the laces are good. Previous Saucony had terrible laces, not this variety of shoe.I\\'ve been wearing the Saucony Original Shadow shoes for 40 years and have found it always comfortable throughout my running years and even now that I use it as a walking shoe.These were very narrow IMO compared with the Born\\'s, Keen\\'s and Merrell\\'s I have bought in the same size.I liked them but they were just a bit too small - short and narrow at toes.These shoes are destroyed already in 6 months of use. They are supposed to be waterproof but within a month, they were starting to rip out. Also not very comfortable. I have had other On Cloud shoes and liked them and they were comfortable and lasted much longer. Not worth $170 for sure.These shoes are stylish, comfortable & waterproof!  This brand is typically 1/2 size smaller than my usual size so I order 1/2 up & it fits well!Love these shoes and they fit great.  Bought to walk in and glad I did!I love these shoes. I get lots of compliments. My feet are pretty wide and they are wide enough. They are surprisingly comfortable for all day wear and I have foot issues like plantar fasciitis.Other skate shoes last me 3 months tops from grip wear on the toe or just from blowouts but NB holds up 6-8 months no problem. Love emThese 306s are a cross between the 255\\'s and the 379\\'s. They\\'re the same length as the 255s, but just a smidge wider in the toe, like the 379s. (The 379 and 379-mids I received both felt a hair longer then both, but pretty close.) Wish these had the same sole as the 255s do, either way, they are a perfect fit for my wide foot after sizing up a half-size.I wear a women’s size 8.5/9 and the 9 fits well. I have a wide foot and so far no issues.feels good. same fit as the 379 or the griffin. more layers, maby a tad more padding, like around the collar. \\'abzorb\\' insoles have nice squishy heel, but too thin at the toe. gonna get new insoles. seems well made, should last.I have owned 4 pairs of Keen Austins over the past 6-7 years. I walk about 3 miles per workday on concrete/pavement. I have also used them as my everyday/runaround shoes. My first 3 pairs of Austins were amazing:\\n1) Great arch support that lasted roughly 1.5 years each pair.\\n2) Wide toe box is perfect for my feet.\\n3) Sturdy construction for the type of abuse I dish out due to my gate.\\n4) Look and feel good for a long time.\\nUnfortunately, my latest (4th) pair have fallen short on the overall quality I have come to expect from Keen. I have owned them for roughly 10 months and this is what I have experienced:\\n1) 5 months into usage they started to squeak. This is exceptionally annoying and distracting. I can live with squeak because I am a function guy ... but I don\\'t like it.\\n2) The arch support has fallen dramatically in this pair. I feel as though my feet are being ripped apart. I still own pairs 2 and 3 for yard work and they are more comfortable than pair 4.\\n3) I have also noticed the stitching is giving way much quicker than the other pairs.\\nI thought that maybe since I have owned 3 other pairs of the Austins that maybe it was a fluke. It isn\\'t. I discovered my father-in-law has a pair of Austins and has experienced all 3 issues I am reporting. I suspect they have made changes to their manufacturing/quality control practices and the end result is a lower quality shoe. I am very disappointed.\\nI also have a pair of Keen activity sandals that are roughly 6 years old. I have been a loyal Keen customer. With my latest experience, I was hesitant to give Keen my business again and moved to another manufacturer and have been very pleased with the decision. My father-in-law is looking to do the same.\\nI have written them about my experience and have yet to hear back...\\nI sincerely hope they look at what detrimental changes have been made with this product and correct them.There is something wrong with me. I\\'ve never been into clothes or shoes. I usually bought my shoes at JL Coombs in Freeport from the discount rack. Blemished, seconds, whatever. Had a great pair of LL Bean shoes that I resoled and re-soled for a decade. Then my fiancee suggested I get a pair of these hideous looking \"Keens\". I bought the Austins, black, size 10.5 One year later: I own 5 pairs...I\\'m turning into the Imelda Marcos of Keens, and I\\'m a straight guy. I just ordered another pair of sandals, and when the soles started showing wear on my original Austins and they couldn\\'t re-sole them, Keen said I could get another pair. I\\'ve never worn anything on my feet so comfortable. I wake up in the morning and I can\\'t wait to put on a pair. How is that for an endorsement?These were great shoes for everyday use. Two things changed. They stopped stitching the sole to the shoe (starting to use an inferior glue) and the rubber used for the sole wares out in under 6 months. Not worth the money.Great shoes for people with wide feet - wide through the mid-sole, very roomy toe-box and adequate arch support. For people with abnormally high arches you may want to undo the laces from the top-most set of eyelets for more freedom in movement. I was also very surprised by the quality of the leather upper of this shoe. Very supple! Wears well with most casual pants (jeans, cargos, cords, etc). Overall a great casual shoe!I absolutely love my Austins! They are the best shoes that I have ever worn. They were a little tight out of the box but I just had to loosen the laces a bit. After that they were perfect! These are very comfortable and are built to last. I have worn them everyday for nine months now and they are still in great condition. My last pair of Sketchers fell apart and had no sole left after just two months. My next pair of shoes will definitely be Keen! Now I just have to work on converting my family and friends to be Keen fans!Great shoe for versatility. They look sharp. The vented design has a dressy vibe. Very comfortable. The shoe runs slight big - about a half size large in length and width. A thicker insole would probably solve it.Great shoe wrong sizeWasn’t the right sizeThese are very stylish tennis shoes. They’re perfect if you’re looking for a simple chic white sneaker. They actually are slip on with laces, which is really nice. Super comfortable. The synthetic letter leather looks great and I like the very discreet gold logo.Looks and feels greatSome of these reviews are hilariously stupid. Obviously, the back is not as thick or supportive as other On sneakers...that is the point for these! Makes you shake your head and wonder about society.\\n\\nAnyway, these are the perfect travel sneaker or one to toss on to go shopping or a casual day out. They are incredibly light and comfortable to walk in. While I would never consider running a marathon in them, they are an excellent shoe for what they are...one of my favorite On or sneakers to date.Love the sneakers but even sizing up feel a bit small in the toe box near the big toes.Back of the shoe is very thin and not stiff enough, compared to the previous pair I had.Very thin top, which makes this shoe very breezy. In any warmer climate this is a great walking shoe. You can run in it, but would not be my first choice for that.My favorite throw on shoes. These shoes are the best for walking all day or quick throw on.I bought these beige suede Stackform and they are absolutely comfortable and for me, true to size. I bought my usual size 8. They fit perfect. The only tennis shoes I wear are vans. I have worn vans most of my life. I have a small frame but, I have a wide foot and they do not hurt my feet. The width is generous. So yes, I recommend these and I love all their stacked too. I hope this review helps someone else. I see some people said they would size down, I would be afraid to, I think a 7.5 would be too small for me. All my vans are size 8 and fit true to size for me. So if you have a wide foot as I do, stick to your normal size. Love, love, love!Great quality as always!!!   I am an older woman and I am a woman of color.   I rock my vans in platform style.  And I love them.  I have about 10 pairI bought these for our daughter going off to school and she said they\\'re comfortable for all day walk + wear. The platform and all black is so nice.I\\'m usually a 9 or 9.5 in most shoe brands, but an 8.5 in these fit perfectly. Definitely agree with other reviewers that you should size down. I do also have concerns about heel blisters but there are too cute that I might bear through any potential pain.I love these shoes! They are really comfortable and look awesome. Would definitely recommend.Purchased these for my father who always wore regular width high top Reebok\\'s but with age his feet have widened and/or swelled so needed something more comfortable and a bit wider. He absolutely loves them and says they are super comfortable with all the room he needs for the swelling in his feet. Thank you for carrying the wider sizes.I feel like the cover of Action Bronson\\'s Blue Chips mixtape B)I have a wide foot so it\\'s hard to find shoes. These shoes fit great and are very comfortable to wear. I went ahead and bought another pair because of all of thatThe fit and the size was fine but the sole wore through in less than 3 months.  The sole is not solid so the waffle like under layer catches rocks.  I can not wear them anymore.Awesome shoe sooo comfortable.  I have wide feet and these shoes are perfect for my big feetThese shoes rock - \\nLots of looks, lots of comments. Very aggro look, super comfort. A kid at my middle school [I’m a teacher] said they look like dinosaur shoes. Whatever. I notice the high schoolers checking out my footwear from the busses, giving me a big thumbs up. Well, I didn\\'t buy them for anyone but me, but still and all...\\nThey seem a tad small for the sizing, but that may change as the very luxurious padding wears in. I just choose thinner socks. All in all, most excellent kicks. Great if you use your feet, and who doesn\\'t. Heck, I’d recommend these to someone in a wheelchair. Live large, and always style.The shoes them self are great there very comfortable and a great shoe I loved them the first time they released them and ordered them again. Only one problem, the stitching on them is absolute garbage. The fabrics should tuck into the rubber on the show but because they weren’t stitched it’s showing the inside layered material color that doesn’t match the shoes! I write this review because I got not one not two but THREE! The fact that these shoes got into there inventory means this company doesn’t check there incoming orders and it means that they also do not check what they are sending out!!!! Basic business practices and they can’t even manage to do that!! The shoes are made in China and they reflect it.I haven\\'t been able find a pair in almost 17 years. Let alone a size 13. These by far are the best Osiris I\\'ve owned e.g. Color patterns and design. I didn\\'t hesitate to purchase them due to lack in availability . The price was a little on the high side in my opinion, but again worth it due to lack of availability.Amazing shoe, I like to call it the best skate shoe of all time. Loads of tech, comfort, durability. 10/10They came in the right size they fit good I have no problem with themI love these and get new ones every few years (I have had navy and white). For reference, I hate the dorky Keds style of sneaks and wear these or Chucks. They do mangle your feet for the first few days but so worth it. (A little wide since they\\'re mens.)A great, lightweight, durable all-purpose shoe! They grip to my bike pedals very well, breathe nicely and are comfortable to wear without socks. Took a few weeks to break in but now they\\'re perfect. They also clean up easily.I\\'m very disappointed in this shoe. The upper became separated from the sole at the mid-foot after the first week of wear, and we\\'ve found the overall support lacking in the sole. When we attempted to replace the insole with an over-the-counter arch support, we discovered a complete lack of support under the 1/8 inch foam insert. While it may be fine for light wear, it does not adequately perform for my active teen\\'s lifestyle. Better to invest money in a better performing shoe that will last a few more months.I love Vans! These are a classic fit and finish, they\\'re comfortable, and goes with everything. Perfect. Just had to find the right size - thanks Zappos for being patient.I love these shoes! They go with most casual outfits.These D3 OGs fit well, look great and got lucky to get my size (6M) as they usually sell out pretty fast. I can remember these when they first came out, so there\\'s a bit of a nostalgic factor too. I\\'d recommend them to anyone who wants a classic skate shoe that I consider iconic in the Osiris inventory.I ordered an 11.5 they ened up being a little small.  Zappos made the exchange process super easy.Perfect fit just what I was looking for thanksWhen I saw that they re-released the D3 I thought it was a cash grab for us “old timers”. I was actually very impressed with these and instantly was brought back to my first pair of D3’s in the early aught’s. Comfortable to wear all day and although I can no longer verify it, I’m sure just as sturdy for your skating needs if you see fit. Easy to slip into when laced up but yet conforming to the foot to wear they will not fall off.Had these shoes freshman year of high school love themI would buy this product over any other product on the market. I have braces that have to go down into the shoes and this company has gone above and beyond making me shoes of a different color that were no longer available on their website. I just ordered two pair of their new white shoes and they are fantastic and do what they\\'re supposed to do with my braces. I\\'ve been using and buying these shoes for many many years. I have tried on over 30 different shoes from different companies over the years and by and far this is the only one I will wear. They are beautifully made and last for a very long time. I love this companyI purchased my third pair in 5 years 4 months ago.  I took them to the store where I purchased them when one of the eyelets for the laces cracked preventing me from using one row of lacing. The employee said I shouldn\\'t wear them every day and that there was no warranty on the shoe.  I\\'m retired now so thats all I wear now.  Maybe she was right because I only wore the previous pairs on weekends. I am disappointed in the quality of the shoe which is a shame because they are comfortable.   But I am more turned off of SAS from the customer service I received. The clerk first said it wasn\\'t the pair I purchased until she compared them to a new pair.  Then she said I hadn\\'t bought 2 other pair without asking if I had purchased them at another store.  Then she said the shoes were older than 4 months multiple times.  My wife asked me later if I counted the number of times she called me a liar.  She took my name and number but I was not surprised she didn\\'t call me back like she said she would. I guess she lied.  I was not asking for a new pair of shoes.  I just wanted a solution to make them wearable.Had to return for a wider shoe, once I get the wider one everything will be great. The rest of the review is from the narrower shoes; I wont say that they are the most comfortable shoe I have ever worn but they are very comfortable. My orthotics fit in them nicely and the heals do not rub like some shoes do with custom orthotics.I will write another review once I get the wider shoes.After getting disgusted with casual shoes lasting 2 years or less, I started wearing some SAS shoes I purchased at least 30 years ago.  I had forgotten how comfortable and well made they were and was delighted to discover they are still made.  They were hard to find in Portland, but I could still order the same size and style on-line.  Website was a pleasure to navigate, shipping charge was minimal, and while there was a generous return policy - that is the last thing I would do.  Certainly plan to try some of the hewer styles.Made in USAThese shoes are super comfortable and offer great support. This would be a 5 star review except for the fact that the material on the top of the shoe tore after 5 (ish) months of relatively light use. This occurred on both shoes. That material is obviously not durable. Unfortunately, it looks like Ecco is using that material more (vs. leather/suede) - I\\'m guessing to cut production costs.These are not the same design as the Biom 2.0.  Although the sole and insole are the same at the same size as the previous 2.0 model, they are not as wide for wide fit :(.  I think it has to do with the redesign of the lacing system.  Buy the Biom 2.0 if you have wide feet, if you have medium feet give them a try.  I like the design better than Biom 2.0, but that\\'s subjective.I purchased this shoes as a present for my husband birthday. I love the design but it makes noise when you are walking. He purchased before Ecco shoes because he has wide feet. Not sure if he is going to keep it.I like this shoe very much. However, I normally wear a size 10, so I ordered the size 10-10.5, but that was too big. It\\'s considerably bigger than all my other size 10 shoes. I then ordered the size 9-9.5, and that fits much better.These look good, and feel pretty good while wearing them and going for long walks. But they\\'re a pain to put on and take off because there\\'s no separate tongue. I\\'ve ordered many pairs of Ecco shoes, but won\\'t buy one with this style again.Love these shoes. Have become a go-to shoe for me. Comfy and so easy to just slip on. Got the Slate for a neutral color to go with anything. Get compliments on their stylish look.First time trying the brand out and I am very happy when them. I like the style, easy slip on and off, very comfortable. I hope they hold up, the quality seems a pair with Vince, too Boot and many other brands. I bought the grey and blue as well.As a gift, family member works in event industry, sneaker comfort with fashionable style perfect shoe(sneaker sock). He loves there is no shoe tongue, slip on sock built in.Shoes were returned last week.Excellent fit and exactly as I was looking for.The right shoe fit great the left shoe was too small. it is a big problem with my husband and he had a pair of Rockport that he got years ago that seemed to work. But the older he has gotten the hardest is it too fit him.Did not fittoo narrow- returned for refundOrdered my US size, however their EU sizing seemed a bit off after putting them on my feet. I normally wear 39 EU, 6.5UK, and 7.5US. Somehow these were a 41 in EU??  Overall, I think these are excellently made but just very odd sizing. I would know your true EU size before ordering these and order accordingly vs standard US sizing.I received 2 different sizes of shoes in the same box. I received an 8.5 and a 9, obviously a returned item that wasn\\'t checked properly.These shoes are exceptionally comfortable. I was very impressed with the quality and fit. I recommend these shoes.Shoes fit well. It is very hard to put on, the opening is super small. Also shoes are very noisy, sounds like I\\'m farting every time I take a step.Shoe runs large - had to returnfelt tight even though length was correct. Basically, felt constrained within the fabric area of show.Shoe was too big overall and as a result when laced the portion of laces and tongue was very wrinkledI absolutley love these shoes! I got them from a local skate shop and love the mid top look. They are true to size and fit perfectly. I love the seamless shell toe design which is great for the skater without enough money to buy shoes a lot. I already have done 1,000 tricks and the shoe still looks new. I used to ride the fusions and sabres and honestly was impressed with these. Anybody who wants a sick looking shoe with durability and performance with a modern look, these shoes are the choice. Also for wide footed skaters globes hooked us up with a wider base vulc.These are some great shoes. They\\'re nicely constructed and felt solid. Sadly, they run what felt like a full size too small. So I sent them back, but I am ordering a new pair a size larger! You should get a pair!Very comfortable shoe. Stylish, great for chillaxing in as well as skating. The only was that the front looks a bit small and be sure to order them a half size bigger then your normal size.We placed our order on a Monday and expected it to take 3 to 5 business days to be delivered.  They arrived the next day.  This is the third time we\\'ve ordered shoes from Zappos, and will definitely do it next time we need shoes.I bought these shoes for my brother. He already had them and loved the way they looked and felt. I received these shoes today and he promptly tried them on. The first thing he noticed was that the shoe laces were a tad short. Other than that minor detail, the shoes are amazing. By the way, he can\\'t get over how fast these shoes were shipped!True to ECCO fit and comfort, these Sport Offroads are certainly the most welcome my feet have ever felt. They provide comfort and support almost to the medical device level. OK, so I\\'m overwhelmingly impressed, with good reason. Look again and again, yup, they\\'re that pretty too.Very difficult to put the shoe on through small opening with elastic fabric. Fit felt OK, but shoe threw my normal walking stride off.43 was too large and did not like the lookstight at anklesMy husband really likes the style. Not the most comfortable because little to no arch support.Nice shoes vary comfortableVery comfortable shoes.  I may purchase another pair I like them so much.Fit great looks goodGreat arch support. Easy slip on  easy slip offSize runs big. The shoe is light feeling.Love everything about this  sneaker the look is great so you can see from the picture how they look also the sneaker has fur inside now let’s get to size comparison, I’m going to get to different sneakers for reference. I bought these a size 10 and this fits my foot perfectly. So I wear anywhere from a size 9 to 10 depending on the sneaker. I wear a size 9 in uptown’s. I wear a size 9 1/2 in timberland field boots or Construction boots and I wear a size 10 in Yeezy 700 wave runners. Also wear a size 10 in new balance. All of these sizes I mention have the same fit on my feet. So this hopefully gives you an ideal of how the boot should fit you.The shoes were a bit too rigid for me, granted I didn\\'t wear them long, i just tried them on and then returned, more because I didn\\'t love the style in person than the fit.These look great and are comfortable enough. The reason for the single star rating is because they scuff unbelievably easy. Given they are white, I wear them for very particular occasions as I like to keep my shoes as clean as possible. I also clean my shoes after I get home. I’ve owned these since June and they look like I have worn them for over a year as the exterior material is already saggy and they have scuffed like crazy. Again, I’ve worn these for airport travel and some light street walking. Beautiful looking though.A little tight but not uncomfortable. The style is perfect for work.My hubby likes these shoes.  They are dressy enough for special occasions, but casual enough for everyday.  He thought they felt a bit small so he reordered in a 1/2 sz larger.  He is happy!Description states - Traditional Laces however these are slip on shoes and were way too big.FIT, SIZE AND SUPPORT ALL GOOD HOWEVER. . . After wearing this shoe twice, the back of the shoe collapsed making it impossible to wear.  Very poor construction or design. The shoe is meant to be a slip on. The laces shown are for appearance and not functional, therefore trying to \"slip them on\" stresses the back of the shoe which soon breaks down. I will not be buying anything from Deer Stag again.Perfect!These shoes were ready to wear out of the box. The leather is a great quality. Plenty of arch support and great grip on the court! My pickleball game has had a boost from my new Golas!The fit was great, but I didn\\'t like the amount of white on the sole. It went up too far on the sneaker.They fit great and look great, I wore them the first time to a job interview and I was hired, so they\\'re also lucky shoes.This is my first pair of “dress sneakers”. Wanted something I could wear to work. Bought Vionic brand because wife has many pairs of their shoes.  \\n\\nReally happy with these. Not as soft or flexible as a running shoe, but plenty of support and day long comfort. Strong arch support which took a day to get used to, but now I do not notice. \\n\\nGot a lot of compliments first few days of wearing, so apparently, my shoes needed to move into the 21st century.Not sure how this is an 8 .  The box said \"8\" but had the EU sizing of 42.  a EU 8 is a 39.    Clown Shoes.  I ordered the Beach Vionic in an 8 and a perfect fit and the. box is and \"8\" and 39 EU.I ordered a medium width in this shoe-typically with vionic brand I get a wide width.  They fit perfectly with heavy socks and that is exactly what I needed from these shoes.Love these even for a woman. Reminds me of the old K-Swiss but better arch support. Perfect for PickleballThe unisex \"men\\'s\" Lucas Sneaker is an attractive quality leather shoe for everyday that provides excellent support and comfort. I\\'ve had trouble with pain in the back of my accelerator foot for years but these stylish shoes eliminated it. Thank you!Very comfortable. True to size.The is a fantastic new shoe by J&M! I would say it feels like a cross between the Prentiss and Summit. More support than a Prentiss and the oil full grain of the Summit. I wear 9m and 9.5m but went with 9.5 for this shoe. The sole has less white than the Prentiss, which allows a more dressy application but still perfect with jeans. The insert has a little thicker design and this shoe will be a huge success.The shoe is perfect to wear for any occasion and very comfortableThese are really nice and comfortable shoes, this is the third pair of shoes I have had, love them!This is my second pair of these (different color) because they have become my favorite everyday shoe.I love the style and comfort.The material is good and it fits perfect.Very nice shoe I would recommendI have Neuropathy in my feet, both knees are unstable, so comfortable, nice looking, featherweight shoes are very important to me.This is a perfect fit both length and width to the size I have worn for years. My wife has been wearing a pair of the slip-ones (has since bought 3 more pairs) and says they are the most comfortable sneakers/tennis shoes she has ever worn, so I ordered these in my size and she is correct - I think this is the most comfortable sneaker I have ever worn. It is great not to have to lace up my sneakers when I put them one but these fit just like I had laced them up and they keep their fit. The quality and workmanship are excellent. Great value.Every day use ,the ones that fit are are very convenient a easy to wearI like their look. The sides are stiffer than expected and padding is not as good as my other sketchers I own (I have at least 6 other pairs of sketchers). This makes them less comfortable than I expected.Typical Mephisto fit.  Narrower in the fore part than Match.  About the same as Dribbler.  Good arch and ankle support.  Colors are ok, construction first rate.I had to return the first pair for a wider width, but my husband loved the color and style of the shoe.The shoe fits perfectly and my shoe inserts give added arch support.  The shoe has removable inserts.I bought these for my father hoping that he could get the triple E width on and off easily, but it proved impossible.  I can\\'t really speak to their comfort or fit because he couldn\\'t get them on.The shoe was beautiful and looked to be well made.  The problem is that they’re for my brother who is in a nursing home.  He has very wide feet. The problem with the shoe is the shoe opening was too small for his foot to slip into. The shoe he is wearing now is Prope’t 4or5EE and they have straps and a tongue that pull’s up to get them on. He would like a slip on without straps.  Recently a podiatrists told me to check out the New Balance. Would you have something in that brand or even Skechers (slip on)?Loved the shoe and have worn them almost every day. After 8 months the material on the side towards the toe split about 3/4”. It wasn’t a seam split and there wasn’t anything apparent that caused it. I really liked the shoe plan to reorder it and hope it lasts longer.This was my first purchase of a Josef Seibel shoe. Having bought other European sized shoes, I went by past experience and ordered this shoe in size 44; it fit perfectly in length and width. (I normally wear a US size 10.5 E or W.) I was very pleased with the roomy toe-box and removable foot-sole insert, which provides a soft and comfortable feeling when standing or walking.\\n\\nOne problem I did encounter was with the color: Taupe. The attached screen shots provide a comparison of the shoe as shown on the Zappos and Seibel sites. The darker color in the Seibel site photo is the color of the shoe I was sent by Zappos. I would have preferred the lighter-shaded color. Nevertheless, considering its fit and comfort, the Seibel Louis 06 shoe is a keeper.The shoe is very stylish. The first pair I ordered was too big, but the return was easy to do. Zappos quickly sent the next size that I ordered. Very pleased with the product and the ease of returning and reordering.great looking shoe and very comfortable...but way too big....even with double thick socks.  I hate to return but no choice and half size smaller not available.The problem with this shoe is with the lacing.  With it laced all the way up it is hard to put the shoe on.  Even loosening the lacing significantly, it is still hard to put on.  Unlike other shoes, loosening the lacing is fairly easy.  On this one no.The design is poor…the laces are too long and when you cinch them it creases the shoe which looks sloppy…I like how it transitions into a slide but again…what’s the point when the laces drag the ground…good idea, poor design and even worse QA…Fit well, width a little snug, but we like that. Husband needs shoe that provide stability and are easy to close (laces aren’t suitable). This shoe has all of the features we need and look nice on feet.I sent them back along with another pair, both pairs hurry my husbands sensitive feet.. but I only got one refund for one pair not the other pair.. I hope we refunded the the second pair ..He kept othe gray propet shows out of 3 pairs.the material was very comfortable and stylish  i have severe neuropathy and these shoes are a god sendCould not get my foot into shoe.  Need wider fit and slightly longer.This is one half size bigger than the usual one.  It gives room for heavy socks in the winter.  Velcro helps with shaky hands.Good just too big.  Between sizesExcellent shoe. I\\'m a letter carrier for USPS. Walk countless miles, tried many shoes. I have flat feet and mild knee and lower back issues -- this shoe fixed aches. Light weight, durable, breathable - worth every penny. Order now. I\\'m on my 6th pair in three years - yes, I walk 350 miles a month. I\\'ll never walk in anything else. Flip flops a must as well. Sizes run small to me. Order 1/2 size or one size bigger than you wear.I will honestly say pay no attention to the 3 star rating on these shoes. I was hesitant to get these shoes because one reviewer said they were poor quality. I wish they had gone more into detail about the poor quality and exactly why they would say that. I honestly don\\'t represent the company in any way. I will tell you that I don\\'t see the poor quality in these shoes. I have removed the inserts, I have tested them with trying to twist them and bend them in half and they are solid. Maybe the person was referring to a piece of plastic on the bottom and back of the shoe. If you look at the picture of the shoe, the grey piece on the back and on the bottom is plastic but that doesn\\'t affect the overall integrity of the shoe. That\\'s cosmetic only and isn\\'t going to affect the way the shoe feels on your foot. The stitching and how it is pieced together, I don\\'t see the poor quality as mentioned. Trust me, I have an eye for detail and if these shoes were poorly made, I would say so as I have said so about other shoes. These may not be for you if you are a runner but for walking they are great. They do say to walk in them for a couple of hours to get your foot adjusted to the feel. I will admit, when I first put them on, I was hesitant and almost wanted to send them back but after wearing around for a day in the house my feet do feel much better. I have plantar fasciitis that flares up occasionally but these do help me, they really do. Everyone is different when it comes to plantar fasciitis or foot pain but all I can say is give them a try if you are a walker or experience foot pain. I would also suggest that you go a half size larger than what you normally wear. I wear a 11 1/2 and went with the 12 and the 12 feels good. I give these shoes 5 stars and hope Zappos continues to carry these shoes!Poor quality for price. These are cheap sneakers with an expensive insole. Buy the insoles separately and put them in good sneakers.After trying dozens of brands and styles, this was the only shoe that cured my 2-year old heel pain. Only thing I\\'d like this shoe to have is the same kind of aggressive arch support that the Orthaheel sandals have; the shoe\\'s included footbed provides decent arch support but not as powerful as the sandals.These shoes do not have the great arch support found in the orthoheel flip flops. The arch in these walkers is just in a small area--the flipflops have a longer arch that covers the whole arch of my foot. I had to return them.Great look and comfortable.too large based on my shoe size.   need to return for next smaller sizeI have always known Clarks to make a comfortable shoe, but this one has some style as well.I was hoping these would fit better because they are attractive and reasonably priced. I liked them a lot, they were just far too narrow for my foot. Mephistos are what I ended up with.It hurt my feet after a few hpurs wearing it.These should\\'ve come out a decade ago.  Always thought the old skool had too narrow of a lace pattern for my taste, but I didn\\'t like high tops.  These have the widest toe box next to the half cab, of the original core classic series (outside of sk8 hi of course).  Originally I got the pro model of this shoe, and altho that fit me good, they are a lot bulkier and heavier than these.  I use pro series shoes for work as a mechanic and they\\'re durable.  Haven\\'t tried the skate series that replaced the now obsolete pro series, so I have no opinion on that... But typically I would buy pro series as most models were wider than the classic series option.  This is gonna be my new \"lifer\" shoe I buy over and over again as long as they continue to make them.  The authentic, era and old skool models have evolved with a more narrow toe box, than what I can wear anymore, compared to a decade ago. I have very abnormally wide feet. Quality of the core classics has decreased and the soles have less padding than they used to.... But I\\'m feeling these.  Got my usual 8.5 size with a 1/4\" front to back space for mid day foot swelling and they\\'re great.  Highly recommend if you have wide feet and searching out the best looking vans shoe being made right now.these are exactly as i imagined. super cool style. perfect fit. i love the black suede, it’s a darker black than the just clothe black old skools without suede. the sewing is good too. nothing is damaged. this is my first day wearing em so idk how theyll hold up but im assuming a long time because theyre vans.Toes fit just like they do in the sk8 hi topsI’ve always dreamed of a world that would have my favorite Vans Sk8-hi in a low version, and now I’m far beyond happy. Really glad that Zappos introduced me to this version as I had no idea it existed. The fit is just like any other pair of classic Vans but the cut and stitching screams Sk8-hi’s. I went with the melon color and I’m typically rocking black & white vans, decided to change it up a bit. Still getting used to the color but I overall love it. I’d say it’s giving orange creamsicle vibes. Nonetheless; tremendous shoe for casual or sport wear.I have no idea as they stole my money and did not deliver the shoes.. NO OPTION TO SPEAK WITH SOMEONE OR GET ANY ASSISTANCE AS THEY STOLE THE PRODUCT!!!I bought these for my husband who has narrow feet and an incredibly difficult time finding casual shoes to fit. I He really likes the style, the leather seems like a good quality, and best of all they fit his long, narrow foot well!Excellent business casual show. Same exceptional build quality as traditional dress shoes.I ordered these in grey with special ordered red soles and the look is great that\\'s why I gave it 2 stars. The big issue is the firmness of the sole of the \"sneakers\". I was in the military in the 70s and my Combat Boots did not have soles on them that are as firm \"I mean HARD!\" As these sneakers. It has the feel of a wooden sole. \\n\\nI don\\'t know who you have at Allen Edmonds that designs these \"Shoes\", because they\\'re not sneakers.Full size larger than actual size.  will be returning for smaller size if availableThese are my new favorite shoes! I love being able to dress them up or down for any occasion and they feel great on my feet.I just bought a pair this evening and they were the most supportive and comfortable show I\\'ve ever purchased. I had tried on three others pairs of shoes before trying Terrawave sneaker and as soon as I put these ones on I knew they were the ones!As a nurse I spend 12+ hours in these shoes, many of them standing. I put in about 8-10k steps and 30-40 stair flights a day and these are by far the most comfortable, rugged, and stylish shoe I have ever had. They hold up very well to the stress I put on them. I feel so grateful I got these.I really enjoy the Terrawave Sneaker for everything I do. I walk our golden retriever twice daily and I do all my daily stuff with them. The Sneakers are comfortable and have just the right support for me without being over the top.These sneakers were so comfortable the moment I put them on.This is a very comfortable shoe and excellent for walking.Shoe made my feet so hot.  I wore them for 30 mins and had to take them off.  No breathability whatsoever.1. Comfortable Fit\\n2. Perfect Design\\n3. Past Delivery\\n4. Good PriceTo be fair, I never even tried these on. Because as soon as I got them out of the box I realized they have SCENTED SOLES. The soles of these shoes smell exactly like the pink hand soap in rest area bathrooms. Too bad because they looked pretty cute but not worth smelling like that - hard pass.All mephisto are a full size too large. I\\'m a 9 so I get an 8. Shoes are heavy but\\n\\nfor my ankle and Achilles tendon problems  they are supportive and my doc likes them.\\n\\nI have 3 pair.This is my third pair of Mephisto Vito\\'s. They  are a full size too large so I order down. I\\'m a 9 but in Mephisto Vito I\\'m an 8.\\nThe shoe is a  bit heavy but attractive. My podiatrist says they are excellent for my ankle and Achilles tendon problems \\nbecause the shoe is  not lightweight and flexible so it holds my foot in place. Hey, it is better than a brace, believe me.\\nThe shoe wears well. Heel does not erode quickly. I will order several more. I don\\'t even look at other brands.Mephisto fan with multiple pairs from them. All their shoes are built to last. Glad to see they are offering more causal contemporary styles without compromising on quality.  Very happy will be buying another pair in another color.I own other shoes by Mephisto and I typically have to order 1/2 size greater in order to get the shoes to fit correctly.  I did the same this time and the shoes were too large.  I reordered at my true size and the shoes fit properly. They are light and comfortable.  I wear them as an every-day walking shoe.  If they are like the other shoes I have from Mephisto they will last for years.I’m an Ecco fan but decided to try these for style and comfort. I love them, so much so I bought both colors. Great support and comfort.Perfect for holiday parties or just showing offI love these shoes and you will tooPerfect for the holiday season.  My husband likes them.Well I liked these shoes and bought them for my guys but they said NO WAY! I love seasonal items. I\\'ll find a friend to share these with.Love them for Christmas!!! Great shoes as always. But now my Hey Dude Christmas collection is growing!!They feel great when I put them on. The problem is when I start to work - these shoes are heavy! I didn\\'t realize how heave 1 pound shoes felt compared to 10-12oz shoes. Unfortunately I had to return them.ExcelentThe lacing system is amazing!!These are awesome. I wear size\\n12 in womens (this is a woman! Lol) and I love the Taos sneakers but the women’s version ran way too small, so I got a 10.5 in men’s and it fits perfectly. I need a wider toe box for wiggle room due to a precious toe sprain, but my heel is narrow. These are one of the only non-running tennis shoes that my heel does not slip out of. \\n\\nThey are cool, casual, and I’m sure my husband would wear them too. They are pretty gender neutral, like vans or chuck taylors! 5 stars!!Returned the 10.5 (my normal shoe size) for an 11.  These fit much better.  They are a nice looking shoe and have a quality feel in both material and fit.  Particularly impressed with the thick, supportive footbed insert.I really did love this shoe, but sizing just didn\\'t work out in my favor, so I had to send them back. The shoe was defiantly a quality shoe and I\\'ve never seen a canvas shoe offer this much support in a quality build. It\\'s a must have, if you can find your size. It was also pretty stylish shoe thats more on the casual side.\\n\\nWhat ultimately led to the return is sizing. I\\'m typically between a men\\'s 12 and 13 and mostly because of width. My foot measure just shy of a 12 in length and exactly a 12 in width by standard measure, so when available, I usually try a 12.5. This shoe fit pretty true to size for me. The 12 was ok in length with little room in the toe, but the width was a little too snug when standing. The 13 was great on width, but just a little too long. I was ok with the extra room, but the toe made a constant popping noise when I stepped. The arch support also seemed to fall a little too far forward and I questioned whether that would really offer comfort on long days. I would love to see this shoe in a 12.5, but until then I\\'m sad to say I cant keep them.I’ve only had these shoes for two weeks, but so far I love them. They’re comfortable and have loads of arch support. They look great with smart casual clothes. I think I’m going to buy another pair in a different color.Size is perfect, great arch support and look great!Very muchAlways felt like the original Toms were a bit cheap and sized too small, but these were PERFECT. True to size and love the thicker soles, much more comfy and supportive, and bottom soles are more sturdy too. Will be wearing for a long time!Really nice summer show but sizing is wrong. I ordered a 10 based on other reviews and they fit.  I’m a 10 1/2 in all other shoes and in previous Tom’s shoes. Disappointed they can’t get the size right. The three other pairs of different Tom’s shoes I just ordered are all too big.Looks cool and I really liked these but the toe box was too narrow for me even at a half size larger than I normally wear.you would have to have a ballerinas foot to insert it in to this shoe, even at a size larger. And the return process is way more cumbersome than it used to be.So far so great! Very comfortable and stylish. Go with everything. My other Steve Madden shoes have lasted me years, hoping these will hold up too.Don\\'t know why but they made my feet hurt.Within two weeks of wear, the shoes developed a tear in its plastic that essentially became a sharp knife that cut my heel.Doesn’t breathe — shoe with or without socks is very warm after wearing a while. Mesh outside doesn’t mean breath-ability inside. Cushioned, but not supportive interior. Quite unlike the SAS shoes I normally wear. They’re OK, but I wouldn’t buy them again for summer use. Winter use with socks would be OK, with a swap-out of insoles.Comfortable, great for casual everyday use.  Would not go on a long hike with these.Very comfortable and I use sketches all the timeAngenehm zu tragenthe fit and size were great:  room for my toes! however there is very little support in this shoe.  Even with my orthotic there is little support.These are halfway between a minimalist shoe and a high-end running shoe.  Most running shoes overdo the cushion, so I love these. The toe does curve up a bit, but less badly than the latest running shoes (I\\'m looking at you, Asics!)  \\n\\nThe rubber sole is beefy, and should hold up to extended wear.  The upper is a bit skimpy on the padding, but that is just fine for me.  \\n\\nI never use factory insoles, but these seem better than average.These shoes are perfect for my messed up feet. Third version of this style/brand I\\'ve purchased. I\\'m now spoiled for comfort.Only worn them for a couple of hours but these are extremely comfortable shoes. So nice to have decent looking shoes with multiple width options. This is the second model shoe from Propet I\\'ve worn and love the brand.Great so far.These are probably the most comfortable shoes I’ve ever owned. I now have them in two different colors and love them.Definitely love the shoes. They look great and feel great, however I do feel like they’re just a tiny bit big on my feet, but I have a weird foot that sometimes with certain styles/brands 11.5 will feel a bit too big, but then 11’s are too tight. Still a great shoe though for everyday use.Like the shoe overall. Classy yet functional for multiple uses. Just not as much padding and arch support as I hope for. Already replaced the soles. Other Nunn Bush shoes I\\'ve worn I\\'ve supported my feet better.Good shoe, runs true to size.Very lite weight for comfort.Comfortable and modern lookingVery comfortable and looks so clean!Good quality, although may be a bit stiff for those with sensitive feetThese are nice casual shoes but if you need an arch don’t buy these. There is NO support for your arch. Unfortunate.Initial fit is pretty tight. These, and you, will benefit from a good breaking-in period, and it\\'s worth it. They\\'re well-built and will last a long time.Very narrow and stiff. Feels a full size smaller than ordered.too tight throughout ...too heavy to be comfortable...Shoes are nice color, but are way to heavy, and larger that size medium to me, for like wide width.NarrowI should just copy and paste my review for the Soft 7 because these \"premier\" have the same problem: they are WAY too narrow. They\\'re more narrow than any other ECCO shoe I\\'ve worn in the past 20+ years. ECCO\\'s size EU44 have always been perfect, but NOT in this shoe--at all.I have older pairs of these sneakers and they fit great. The new design is way too narrow in the top of the foot. And I have narrow feet! Very disappointing.This shoes are flawlessly designed and beautiful! Some reviews say that they were a bit narrow which maybe so, but they fit me perfectly! I already purchased a Cole Haan version of this shoe that cannot compare! Maybe Ecco needs to make two versions of this shoe, one narrow and one wide! Two  thumbs up! ……now let me continue on to order the black version!AWESOMEThese are the most comfortable pair of shoes I\\'ve ever worn. I really hope that they continue to make these shoes for a very long time. They are the only shoes that I would ever wear and would like to see a pair of dress shoes with the platform cushion on them. I have several pairs of SAS shoes, they are all very comfortable, but these are the most comfortable I\\'ve ever had. Thank you to the entire SAS team for making the best shoes on planet earth.Outstanding shoe, it took about 2-3 days for my foot to acquaint the feeling. That being said the shoe has incredible attention to detail and is very high quality.Not your Grandma\\'s SAS.  Looks and feels great.  Though rare for me, this was one of the brands that I needed to size down by a half-size.The way the upper part sits on the sole doesn\\'t give good support. It makes my ankles tired trying to stabilize myself on them.I am writing this for my husband, since he said he would not take the time to do this.  This was my husbands first pair of SAS Shoes, as he never liked the looks before.  He loves that they are made right in Texas but just would not wear them.  I just purchased this pair for him in the blue color and he absolutely loves them.  He says that it is the first shoe in a very long time that he can be on his feet literally all day long and they still feel great.  This shoe looks great on him also, basically like a Cole Hand or something more fashionable.  You can tell this is a very high quality shoe.This shoe was heavier than what I expected it to be plus it didn’t have the arch support that I needed. I tried them on in my bedroom but after not feeling comfortable, I returned the shoes back in the original packaging.The shoes are very comfortable and look amazing. The problem was with the size. My husband wears a 13, but in this show the 13 was at least 2 sizes too big!I took me a second try to get the size right (1st try was too small).  Love them!Nice looking shoe and good quality. Unfortunately, they seem to run about one size small. I normally wear size 10, which I ordered and they were too small. I exchanged for a 10-1/2 and they are still too tight. I am trying to stretch them out and hopefully I can wear them with comfort.I wear orthotics and have wide feet which severely limits my (stylish) shoes options. I plan to use these all year for smart casual to casual attire. These fit just right when paired with thin dress socks. I have not taken them out yet, but assume the quality will be similar to my other Florsheim pairs.\\n\\nFor reference I ordered 11W. I also own Heist sneakers 11W, Midtown loafers 10.5W, and Midtown oxford 10.5XW.I had my shoes only three weeks when the Shoestrings broke already. Between paying for shipping And now having to buy shoestrings every three weeks, the 25% discount did not seem to go too far.This shoes are very comfortableShoe looks great and true to size - purchased black would consider other colors - denim color would be outstanding.Never wear them just walk in my house.my husband, who is  vision impaired, has no problem putting his Skechers onBecause of severe arthritis and spinal problems, putting on shoes has become difficult. These shoes are fantastic--unbelievably comfortable and light and super easy to put on and take off,I purchased these shoes specifically for my jaunt thru the Orlando amusement parks. By far the most comfortable pair of shoes I\\'ve every owned.I purchased these for my husband who is very picky. He hasn\\'t taken them off! Says they are so comfortable and likes how easy they are to put onMost comfortable after toe amputation.  No more hard shoes.Absolutely no arch support an zero cushioning. Not comfortable at all. Returned.Fit fine but after further thought price was a deterrent.   Returned order.This is the most uncomfortable Olukai shoe I have ever owned.   It has none of the classic Olukai traits such as softness, cushion, comfort.Didn\\'t like the color. Felt 1/2 size too big. Looks like a regular sneaker, nothing special.I use it for walking in all kinds of weatherI will be using these shoes primarily for trail hiking. I needed something with better ankle support without being too large or heavy.Needed a pair of Skechers that are water proof that I can wear to walk my dog when it has been raining or when dew is on the grass. These are perfect and really comfortable for all day wear.Good for walking in the slush and snow.These are waterproof that makes them warmer in the winter. They are comfortable and look cool.This is an amazing shoe. Stylish, extremely comfortable and goes with anything. I was really impressed by the level of comfort it gave me. Definitely worth a 5 starLove the shoe!  Super stylish and a great deal!Hard to fit duck feet. This sneaker gives toes room to wiggle. Lace up keeps heel secure. Size 9 to 10 in women’s shoes are fair fit. Going to a men’s size 8 for sneakers works wellI already wrote a review. I want to double down now. This is a great shoe for women with duck feet and narrow heel. I put some Ugg inserts in the men’s size that I bought. My feet are very happy.ComfortableGreat fit.Great fit and size also a good price.This shoe surprised me. It’s the first time I ever bought Skechers and it’s been a long time since $80 shoes felt so good. So good so far. I like the style and the fit and suspect that they will get even better with use.The show size is fine, looks are what I expected but the shoes cause blisters on the back of the heel.  Due to the elastic nature of the shoes they do not seem to be breaking in too quick.  \\nI like the shoes but cannot wear them for extended periods, will continue to try to get them to relax.I am a 10&1/2 medium and the fit is 100% on the money.  The shoes feel amazing and can easily be worn with nice shorts or even casual evening wear.  Definitely would buy these again.Too narrow and tightSnazzy looking shoe!  Can wear to gym or just going out on date.Stylish and comfortableThese shoes are misleadingly described as “leather”. They are plastic with suede accents. \\nBecause they not genuine leather as described, they are not breathable, comfortable or supple.\\nI would not recommend.About a full inch longer than the indicated size. Not sure why companies don\\'t adhere to standards. I now have a pair of shoes that are too large and an extra errand to run to return them. Won\\'t be buying from them again.Size DOWN! \\nGreat looking sneaker and amazingly comfortable. \\nI recommend sizing down a full size as they run very big. \\nCalled Zappos and the exchange process couldn\\'t be easier - I don\\'t even have to leave my home!\\nMy new size should be arriving in 2 days, and I fill follow up on my review.Fit well. Comfortable.Have worn ECCO golf shoes for many years and love them for comfort and style! This is the reason I purchased ECCO Street Retro Sneaker. Seem to have the same feel for comfort as I get from the golf shoes. I\\'m a fan!The look and feel of these was perfect, but the shoes hurt my feetTheses shoes squeaked every step, wether on carpet or hard surfaces.Looks good in pic but not in person.ummm...first, these shoes were very narrow especially on the toes.  i did not like it at all but also, it was stiff and not giving at all, speaking of the sole.They are very comfortable.  I bought two more.great design and arch supportThe wide fit is so comfortable. My foot isn\\'t squished like in other brands of shoes. It\\'s like I\\'m waking on clouds. I\\'m so satisfied with these and can\\'t wait to buy more shoes like these !!!I use it daily, it is pretty cool looking and comfortable. I would definetly reccoment it.Comfortable \\nPrefect\\nStylish \\nBudget friendlyNice looking but extremely narrow and uncomfortable.I ordered another style of shoe and it was out of stock and it is still not in stock so I settled for this shoe. Sometimes things happen for a reason. I love this shoe. I wear an orthotic insole in all my shoes and this shoe easily accommodates the orthotic and the shoe is stylish. It looks great with jeans and it has a solid feel so I can use it for short hikes or long walks. Because I spend a lot of time outdoors and in casual wear, this shoe is a good choice.My daughter loves these shoes. They are comfortable and true to size. More importantly, Zappos proves its commitment to customer service time and time again. They are the best!It\\'s very comfortable, and it came in less than a week. I suggest getting the exact size you wear for your other sneakers. Great for girls and guys! They also come with white laces. I got the ones with yellow laces, but the white came too for free.Love these shoes! Super simple, bright, and fun! Only downside is the white rubber around the bottom gets scuffed pretty quickly but it\\'s easily manageable with some spray cleaner. They\\'re also not the warmest shoes but that\\'s expected due to the materials.At first I wanted Navy suede etnies Taylor LS but they were out of stock so I decided to find something in that style and discovered Vans. I\\'ve heard about them but now I see that they are brilliant. I bought dress blue and it is very stylish, sexy, comfy and once again very stylish. I am going to buy other colors too. They go with almost everything. I am a 17 years old boy.Very comfortable with good traction.  I also got a couple of complements on how they look..Love these shoes.  Super Comfortable.  Get lots of compliments.  Wish the grey were available in my size.A great looking shoe.  Received many complements. Very comfortable.Very comfortable shoe and sporty looking! I love the blue colors together!They run a little large but very comfortable and they look good. Hopefully they are not discontinued so i can get multiple colors.Closed toe - can\\'t expand to fit foot. you would think with shoestrings, it would expand but it does not.This shoe was very rigid and stiffbUENA cOMPRAI\\'ve ordered two pairs of these shoes in white and brown now and love them. Perfect width and so comfortable! I have larger feet for a woman since I\\'m tall and I often opt to get men\\'s sneakers since it\\'s easier to find a size that fits. These don\\'t feel too manly and are pretty neutral sneakers so I love them!However, order was shipped to wrong house. I was able to find my item two houses downGood for and good cushion. Tough to find good looking wide shoesVery nice shoes but the size isn\\'t true they run larger. I had to return them to get smaller size 8.5 for an 8 but they were on back order so I\\'m still waiting for them.For slip-ons these are great. The left shoe is a little loose and my heel slips a bit in them, but other than that I really like these shoes. They are really comfortable and look great.Great shoe, fits well and great quality. Got this shoe on sale so not sure it\\'s worth the regular price point but great shoe just the same.Extremely comfortable!Quality and comfort  Great tennis shoe, very satisfied. I have had a pair in the past and will continue to purchase the same style shoe.These are the cutest shoes I have purchased in a long time! I already have them in 4 colors! I can\\'t stop!Unfortunately the shoes came dirty and they are way too narrow for my feet. Maybe a half size up if you have wide feet. I just couldn\\'t bother with wearing them out a bit. They are cute but sadly returned. Wish they would make these in a slightly wider size.My second pair! So YES huge fan! Soooo comfortable and lighter then the Style 93 which I still love and have worn since 93!  Affordable for a well made sneaker! Available in colors to go with anything! True to size! Easy on and off. Not to mention functional / adorable rubber toe cap!  Way to go Vans! Please keep these in your inventory. A MUST have for any Vans fan!I got the all black and they are really stylish and comfortable. I wear a size  9 and that\\'s what I purchased.So cute and easy to wear. Surprisingly feet my wide feet perfectly.These have the potential to be awesome shoes but because they run quite wide, I would need to put regular shoe laces in them to enable lacing them up snug enough at the arch/instep area. I can\\'t try that option out because the elastic laces that come in the shoe are connected in one big loop, so unable to remove and try regular laces. The included \"loop\" elastic lace is  very stretchy, and unfortunately can\\'t be tightened. One size does not fit all in this case!!It was not clear to me from the description that the laces on this style cannot be tightened. The shoes were too loose to wear.My shoes arrived in a timely manner (as all of my Teva orders do!) and are so very comfortable and fun to wear!  When they get wet, they dry quickly too!  Keep up the good work Teva, and I will be ordering more soon!!The MOST comfortable (and stylish) shoe for movement in warmer climates I have ever owned. I\\'m ordering my third pair of Mesh variety now. Can wear with a sporty suit to snazz it up or with any pants or shorts as a perfect complement. You can feel the coolness in your feet. Have six of this model including cloth version which ventilates less but is fine for fall and non snowy weather.These sneakers don\\'t offer a lot of support but I think you can tell that by looking at the picture.   They do have more cushion than converse and they are comfortable but I wouldn\\'t wear them for a really long walk. However, they are cute so I\\'m happy with my purchase.Not as good-looking than I thought they would be.Extremely narrow shoe. Not what you expect from New balance at allMy husband bought me these for simple off path walks and light hikes. My only problem is I like them too much and they\\'ve become my everyday shoe. I would definitely recommend them.You know when you hear a new song for the first time but you immediately recognize the band?  That\\'s this shoe.  \\nThe design elements are all Vans but in a sporty package that\\'s unexpected.  This is my first UltraRange shoe but I\\'m sold.  I bought them as an all-purpose travel shoe and I think they\\'ll be perfect for that application.  Lightweight and breathable so your feet won\\'t run too hot, but the build feels solid and the materials are more resiliant than typical running shoes.  Sturdy enough to handle light trail work.  A great all-arounder!  Runs true to size.Great shoe! Ive worn alot and holding up so far...however the loops on the heel are purely decorative....will pull off if used functionally... The shoe does seem to run small. I wear a true 8.5 womans and all that was in stock were size 9....so glad I ordered bc they fit perfectly.  Other Van\\'s I\\'ve ordered have been 8.5...that fit perfectly.  Just FYI.These shoes are so comfy! A dream to wear and the colors are so funI love the comfort and they\\'re great for everyday use.Very comfortable shoeGood style, but very snug. Felt like a full size off trying to get my heel in. Fabric was quite rough as well, though perhaps mostly due to the poor fit.I have several pairs of these shoes, as the ones I end up using at the horse barn are no longer presentable enough to wear out to a restaurant.\\nThey are well constructed and durable, roomy enough to accommodate my custom orthotics, and easy to slip on and off.Very comfortable shoes. Only one bad about them.  The insoles wears out quickly. Just buy better ones like I did. Got them in January 2018 it’s now December 2018.  A little worse for wear but still very usable.My husband says these are very comfortable. This is his second pair; first pair lasted him at least 5 years. They also accommodate an orthodic which he needs when he is on his feet all day.Perfect from the fist minute.I needed a shoe to help with swollen feet as well as keeping my ankles straight while I am in my wheelchair, and these shoes do that job well. Very nice shoes.Looks cool and I really liked these but the toe box was too narrow for me even at a half size larger than I normally wear.you would have to have a ballerinas foot to insert it in to this shoe, even at a size larger. And the return process is way more cumbersome than it used to be.Shoes fit ok, but not very comfortable at all... within a few minutes of walking I was not able to keep them on.Very comfortable work day shoe.  My husband wears these every where.  Easy to dress up or downRuns small.  Shoe looks good and is comfortable.  Buy a half size larger especially as they dont have Wide.Supper uncomfortable! I don’t even walk much in them and my feet are killing me.I wrongly assumed that a Dr. Scholl\\'s-branded shoe would have a better-than-average footbed.  Instead, it seems these shoes were designed with the idea that a purchaser of these shoes would have no choice but to buy some Dr. Scholl\\'s insoles in order to make these shoes wearable.  Win-win, for Dr. Scholl\\'s.  But bad for the purchaser.  They should include a pair of after-market insoles with these shoes.  It\\'s the only way your knees won\\'t be aching after an hour on your feet in these shoes.Loving these low tops! They\\'re much more comfortable and high quality than I was expecting for $90. Fit is great.This shoe medium width is larger than other shoes.I am overall very happy with this shoe. This was not my first pair of FiveTens so I know what they are usually like.  These are different but I will get to that in a moment.  My other pair is the Freerider Contact.  That is a very different shoe.  It is much stiffer and seems to be geared more towards racing or aggressive riding.   I bought the Sleuths so I could walk with a bit more ease and not have as stiff of a shoe for BMX or walking around town.  These shoes deliver on that and do it very well.  Could I do an enduro or downhill race in them?  For sure.  Would I?  Probably not.    But that\\'s what I have my Contacts for.  These shoes just do not have the stiffness or toe protection for that style of riding.  As for the fit, well they fit a lot like a stiff and narrow pair of Vans.  They are not like Vans though in any other way.  They are far better for riding a mountain bike than Vans.  The only complaint I have about these is that they run really big; like a half size too big.  I think in FiveTen and Adidas\\' (Adidas owns FiveTen) collaborative build of these shoes, the sizing got a bit off.   My size twelve Sleuth was almost a half-inch longer than my size twelve Contact shoe.  You can really see it in the picture.  So you might want to order a half size down.  Also, not a complaint but an FYI, the shoe\\'s sides are real suede leather.  If you ride in the wet or mud a lot, this shoe might not be the best choice.  I will say though that the suede really completes the look.   Overall though, for less aggressive but still hard riding, and better ventilation than a full-blown race shoe, these are some of the best shoes out there.The design is beautiful ,fit and size is correct. The reason For one star overall,is the very poor quality of the material. I purchase those for biking,and after the first ride I had stains on the shoes from the leg sweat, what basically eat the colour. I tried to remove the stains but with no success. Very disappointed!They did not fit well and they looked rather cheap. My son did not keep them.Okay at first until they got wet and the inside toe area wrinkled, shrunk and started to hurt my toes on further rides. I can not wear any longer and I do not know on what to replace them with.\\nMy other pair of Freerider at the same size have had no problems with wear and comfort which I have worn for about two years.\\nI am searching for an alternate biking shoe.Great for cycling great fitting looks good well recommendedI bought these Heely’s for my 7-8 yo niece and she love them. Great BDay gift!I’m usually a 9.5, and the size 10 fit just right. The material contacting around my ankle is a bit stiff and rigid, so I’m hoping that will break in over time.\\nI have never worn Heely’s before, but I started getting into more of a flow after a couple hours of casual practice.Kiddo got them for Christmas and wore them 5 days from\\nMorning to night.  They still look new and are holding up to a “boys tough love.”We originally ordered the right size but it was too small so had to order the next larger size, so warning to potential buyers that these shoes tend to run small. Otherwise they are great and our child LOVES them.Great shoes!Super comfy shoes and as stylish as you could hope for in a XXX wide shoe and are easy to put on.  The only downside for me was the shoelaces are red and black which doesn\\'t go with my clothing so I plan to switch them out.very narrowI don\\'t have a problem with these shoes, it\\'s amazon or whoever shipped these. They were obviously sent to someone else who tried them on and just threw them back in the box and sent them back. Also, they were sent to me after getting repackaged  - NOT THE ORIGINAL PACKAGING!!!!! I won\\'t tolerate this at all!!  Needless to say, NOT IMPRESSED.Great looking pair of shoes that are very comfortable.  They are the perfect casual shoe to wear in the summer and are great with shorts or pants.  They fit true to size but keep in mind with all fabric shoes they do stretch out.These are really nice shoes! Son has a narrow foot and needs a lightweight style, and these are perfect. They are very nice looking too. My son\\'s Podiatrist said it was an excellent choice too.Very attractive well fitting shoes. Foot is narrow and fits really well.This is a very well made shoe. It is very comfortable and also is true to size. It is a bit heavier than a normal running or cross training shoe because of the leather and rubber sole. This would not bother most people, especially if you wear a work boot style shoe.One detail people should know—this shoe comes (deliberately) with *two* insoles. I didn\\'t realize this at first and thought it was too small for me. After removing one insole, the fit was perfect.I\\'m writing a second review of these shoes because I can\\'t figure out how to edit or replace the first one. In my first review I complained that the shoes were too big. (I normally wear size 10, and I first ordered the 10-10-1/2.) And that I didn\\'t expect the next size down to fit, since they don\\'t come in half sizes. Well, I tried the 9-9-1/2 just to make sure. And what do you know, they fit great! I haven\\'t worn them much yet, but they seem very comfortable. And I love the looks. So I\\'m boosting them to 5 stars across the board!Exceeded expectations. Very comfortable and well made. A bit more arch support and narrower toe box than my other Eccos but still true to size.Very comfortable shoe. Normally wear an orthotic insert for support but this shoe gives what I need without. Wore them almost daily for 8 days walking through London and they were fantasticBought these for my husband. He loves them. The picture makes the shoes look brown but let me assure you. They are black. I own a pair of boots by this company too. The quality they put in is great. Def recommend them.they look fabulous. I slip them on they felt great and after wearing them for three days the back of both of my heels were bleeding. Many people have posted how they scrape the back of their foot and I would like to attest to that fact. I really wanted to love them but I’m going to be sending them back. Excellent workmanship beautiful design the size was right for me but they just kept riding up on the back of my foot until I need to walk around with two Band-Aids.Well, the shoes are well made and beautiful to behold. I was very much looking forward to loving them, however as a number of reviewers have pointed out, they rub the back of your heel, and mine was rubbed bloody. So comfortable for about 5 hours then the \"rub\", the only way I could have worn them is with thick socks or bandaids.... so they were returnedShoe is amazingly comfortable. Feels like slippers on my feet all day!  Highly recommend for daily casual shoe.One of my favorite pairs of shoes of all time. Very comfortable and stylish. I wear the daylights out of them and still as comfortable as ever. One little part of the weave has slightly popped out but hasn’t unraveled more than that. I have worn these for at least 2 years. The leather will age like most j and m leather which I like.Has like a cushion sleeping by bag material on the sides of shoes. Will retain water, smells and easily stain.Very light weight! Runs true to size.  My son LOVES these!These are the most comfortable ECCO shoes, that I’ve ever owned. The sole is very soft so I wonder how long they will last, but so far, so good.Fit true to size. Great comfort. Love the colors of this shoeVery good for casual wear. No break in period necessary.I wear these in the house and outside. I love the style, comfort and being able to just slip in. The Bob\\'s are the most comfortable shoe I ownEvery day wear. Love the slip on designIn addition to the good looks, these shoes are very comfortable. i enjoy the fact that you can slip in to them rather than tie a shoe lace.Very cute shoes.  No support at all.  Feels like your forefoot is touching the floor - like you don\\'t have a shoe on.  No for me.Very uncomfortable. Width and length are fine. There\\'s no cushion to it when you\\'re walking. If I was able to return after walking around outside I would.I have neuropathy in both feet so I need a wide shoe.    Although this shoe was a 4E, it seemed narrow for my feet on the toe bed and I would have preferred more cushioning.FINALLY a comfortable wide-width tennis shoe!  I\\'m very happy with this brand.  Because it is seamless on the inside with a padded collar and tongue, there are no \"raised\" areas that could rub against the foot and cause irritation (I experienced this with other more expensive tennis shoes).  The shoes seem very well constructed and the soul looks like it will last for a good while, not to mention their appearance is very stylish/sporty.just came off 2nd pair not happyHubby loved fit right out of the box! Intending to use for long periods of walking and he felt were more than up for the job. Not a huge fan of the style, but going with comfort over style for intended use.Sizes were not accurate, too big.Awesome as always with Cole Hann.   Comfortable right out of the box with no break in required whatsoever.These look and feel great. I was concerned the medium size wouldn’t be a good fit, but they are. Very comfortable.great shoesperfect fitGreat arch support.  I wear a 9.5D street shoe and the 10D were perfect fit. Very stylish, conservative sneaker with great arch support.I have wore the Kore line for years and decided to try the Stance line.  The best dress shoe I have owned, matter of fact I ordered 2 pairs.I have had these shoes for two weeks now and I couldn\\'t be more satisfied with this purchase. I brought the black and cognac pair. Very stylish shoes. Can be worn with either a suit or a casual outfit. Very lite on the feet and I feel that it can be worn all day. Haven\\'t had any problems so far with these shoes. Will be purchasing more in the future.Very comfortable,   Great fit!Love these!! I be stylin and profilin with these shoes. Plenty of cushion to make it a smooth walk and a great everyday shoe. The best part of my experience was the customer, above and beyond once again. Love Zappos and their story.More comfortable than my best pair of tennis shoes. Good value as well. Ordering a pair now for my dad.Looks great, very comfortableJust right in terms of size, width a bit wider but good for me as my right foot is wider. Very comfortable and nice looking shoe.Great shoe but I cant wear it.  I have heel spurs and the seam at the heel cup-to-leather upper is right where my heel spur abuts the shoe seam.  Only Clarks shoe ive ever seen that way,  and I have worn dozens of Clarks over the years.Love the shoe but cant wear it.  A seam connects the heel cup to heel material/padding inside at the heel, and is a nagging and uncomfortable \"poke\" in the heel at every step.  It may soften up but im not going to try.  Clarks makes great shoes (except for soles that you cant clean very easily)  and these are light weight leather and stitched welt instead of cheap foam and glue.  I use orthotics and havent found ANY shoe that supports like a Birkenstock insole to slip in.Nice looking but a half size larger than marked, not that comfortable or much supportPerfect fit, great design, well constructed \\nand very fast delivery.Comfortable shoes, no break in required.Bigger than most Eccos for men.material is greatA little too small. Wish there was a 15.5 to order. I think a 16 would be too large.A little disappointed. These shoes look very cheap in person. You can easily tell the leather is fake. \\nThe inserts that came with the shoes were very slim. I ended up buying inserts on Amazon to make them more comfortable.  Not recommendedGreat Shoes! Great Deal!Great look, very comfortable, feels durable. But the sole is ridiculously slippery on a hardwood floor. Not confident it\\'ll do well on a wet outdoor surface.These shoes are great. So comfortable and classy to wear in just about any situation these days. I\\'ve been wearing them for work with slacks and jeans on the weekend going out. Doesn\\'t matter. I\\'ve gotten complements all around. Strongly recommend!!Received an email promotion from Florsheim and found these slip-on sneakers in my size in a stylish light green color. My order arrived on time and well packaged. These shoes fit perfect and are very comfortable, very little break in time required. I have worn them with both causal and dress clothing giving me a modern unique look. I recommend Florsheim footwear and shopping online at FLORSHEIM.COMGREAT SHOESWear them every where I go.  Very versatile!Great looking shoe that appears to be well made enough in Indonesia to justify the price.  Little arch support.comfortable stylish nice looking casual enough to wear at workThey have a classic look and feel great.  They fit perfectly and are true to size.  I like the comfort and support they provide.My husband love these shoes. These were is his first pair of Ugg\\'s and I told him they would kiss his feet. He just laughed until he tried them on. He is now a true believer. Always great quality.Comfortable and great fit awesome colorWhile they are described as Starry Night and look black on the website they are actually blue. Still a nice shoe but its not what was expected. I kept them anyhow after my initial disappointment with the colour. So buyer beware - still worth it but don\\'t be fooled by the colour on the website and description as Starry Night.Perfect fitThe shoe is same length as the previous ECCO golf shoes I wore, but it feels slightly longer. This may be due to having to tie the eyelets closer than previous shoes to feel snug enough. The shoe is marked as \"Medium\" and I have a fairly wide foot, but it feels wider than a Medium would be. The tongue is sewn to the sides, where the eyelets exist and when I tie enough for it to fit snug, the tongue is wrinkled.If you want to look like you’re wearing orthopedic shoes at any age then get these! They fit fine, but look horrible. I can’t attest to their waterproof-ness because I put them back in the box 3 mins after trying them on. There are MANY more stylish waterproof white sneaker manufacturers out there.Way too narrow to be 4E width. This feels more like a typical 3E or EE. As a result, I can\\'t really comment on the other aspects of the shoe because I could not get them on.I\\'m a long-time customer and in having large feet that need at least a 3E, the Zappos ez return policy is a blessing! With that said, these shoes are nowhere near as wide as marked?! \\nHere\\'s a free tip to Zappos/Amazon... why not initiate a new system, and instead of using meaningless letters that the manufacturer implies? How about actually creating a factual system with the length, width, and height measuring the shoe in inches/centimeters?!I like it.Seem nice enough but felt a bit large and not as comfortable as I expectedThese are like fabric Crocs in terms of style.  That wasn’t what I was buying based on the pictures, but maybe that’s on me.  Fatally, the combo of branding tag and different fabrics creates a brutally uncomfortable rubbing just under your ankle.  Automatic blisters if worn without socks.  Amazingly efficient at rubbing off bandaids, too.  If I could return them, I would.  Now they will head to the landfill.  Shame.These shoes were purchased for my husband who manages a chain grocery store & is on his feet all day.  He replaced the insole with a Dr Scholl’s insole 1st thing. He says that these shoes are super comfortable & allow room for his toes to move. The outer stitching and pebbly-textured leather give them a modern look, they’re attractive.Good lightweight leather walking shoe. Roomy toe box. Great price.Good fitting shoe with comfort and support.  Needs time to break in so ease into the shoe by wearing it first at home.  The high ankle adds extra leverage and balance.  Delivery was good and so was the price.These shoes are very lite weight and comfortable. I work in a hospital setting so I am on my feet quite a bit and for the last 3 months they have Heald up very well.They fit great. Super comfortable. Light but my feet feel well supported. I would buy again assuming that they prove durableThey are fineIt iss hard for me to find shoes I like in my giant foot size without going custom.  I love the style and color scheme of them, they are really comfy and a great every day sneaker for me.  #sweepstakes#sweepstakes I love the quality, comfort and price of these incredible tennis shoes.Worth the money, sturdy ,durable, comfortable, it\\'s must haveGreatJunk!!!!  These would be junk at $39.95 a pair and I paid $139.95!!  Bad construction, cheaply made...you would be better off waiting for Sketchers to go on sale....same or worse quality!!  Unfortunately I wore them outside and now I can\\'t return them, so....out they go!!Shoes were comfortable on day one!Great shoe. Broke my back right before a 3 week travel trip and bought these for the miles of city walking ahead of us. They were insanely supportive and comfortable throughout the tripGreat shoes! My first pair of Allbirds and really impressed with how comfortable they are. Bought these for a vacation coming up where I’ll be doing a lot of city walking and also wanted to use in the hotel gym. Very happy with these and again, very comfortable.Great fit and super comfortableThey are comfortable and go with everythingI don\\'t have a personal review as I buy these For my son for his birthday. I bought him a pair last year and I don\\'t know if he ever wore anything else. When I asked him if he wanted the same, he said yes. I have a few other styles that I\\'ve been very happy with through the years, so we are happy and loyal customers. I love the Albert brand!Good qualityThis shoe is one of the most comfortable shoes I have ever worn. It provides enough support, but you barely feel it on your foot, it’s so soft and fit so well. I bought a couple more pairs in different colors after enjoying my first pair so much.Very comfy and offer good support around homeDefinitely my favorite all birds show ever. Comfortable, able to handle daily walks to light exercise, and everything in between. I ended up going a half size bigger than the 12 I usually went with v1, and I\\'m happy I did. Get it if you want your new favorite shoe.I love all of my Allbirds. They are the most comfortable shoes I have worn in years.Good qualityThey feel really comfortable and provide good arch support.Very comfortable and slides on very easily over my high arch.I like them. Fractured my foot and have an issue with the tendons on top. They are flexible enough to provide less pressure in this area to help alleviate the pain I experience from tie shoes.Outstanding customer service and very comfortable shoesWhile these shoes fit well and are extra wide as described, the \"Max Cushioning\" is just not there.  I have a pair of Skecher mac cushioning lace-ups from a couple of years ago in which the cushioning is great, which I need for my bad knee.  \\n \\nThe cushioning on these is not very good at all and I am very disappointed.This is the second pair of Skechers slip-ins with Max Cusioning. Both have been great to walk around in. Also appreciate the discount I got for this pair of shoes. I may buy another pair in the future. Thank you.Great for almost everything except jogging. Comfort galore! Better than Hoka i have.Great comfortFor many years, I wore size 9 1/2- B. I found the 9 1/2 Medium fits perfectly and makes it fun to walk with great cushioning and support.The sneakers were a half size too short. Very unstable, could possibly lead to rolling your ankle.I want to love these sneakers.  My problem is the ankle area.  Extremely hard to but on.  Extremely tight around the ankle, even changing to a thinner sock and loosening the laces.  I have 3 pairs of New Balance and they are very comfortable to walk in.  These sneakers are not unfortunately.These shoes were comfortable from the beginning. The slip-in aspect is appreciated. Winter salt stains could be an issue with the suede-like material of the upper shoe. The gray coloring of the soles seems to be a veneer as pinhead sized chips have begun to appear around the soles in the short time that I have had these shoes.Great fit and great style.  In a world of wacky, giant sneakers, these are modern and sleek.Fit well and good craftsmanship. Ecco is one of my go to brands. However, laces that came with shoes were excessively long. Original laces were 50\" and had to replace them with 42\" laces.This should have been a great shoe. Maybe I was unlucky and got a bad one, but I had a blister on my heel after my first 10 minute walk. The heels rub easily, though the left shoe was fine, the right one was blister-inducing.These are enormously wide in the heal. They do not fit like other Vince shoes of similar style that I have purchased in the past.This shoe is both Stylish and comfortable.  The value is in the quality.Nice German Army Trainer look, a little stiff and the arch support is almost too firm. But a great looking shoe.The rear heel hit my ankle so low, way down below my (low rise) socks. I am a 30yo woman with a 8.5 WW foot, so I bought a men\\'s 7 wide, they were so stiff, too short in the foot length, and not wide enough; but the worst part was how low they are cut in the back. Never in my life would I have expected this from Vionic. Looking at the shoe you wouldn\\'t expect the rear ankle to be cut so low, this is not a problem I\\'ve ever had with any other sneakers, so this is definitely specific to these. Probably the easiest and quickest return decision I\\'ve made. They were so uncomfortable. Also the fact that there was no option for a half size larger, I won\\'t try Vionic again.These are great-looking shoes! They\\'re super comfortable, and I love the way they look.\\nUnfortunately, the pair I received were very obviously used and dirty, so I had to return them. \\nZappos was great about giving me a refund, and super apologetic. I\\'d buy another pair immediately if my size wasn\\'t sold out.These are perfect in everyway, confortable and have the skechers soft basr fir the extra spring in your step.Stylish and super comfy. Great selection and would buy again in other colors.ComfyI bought the shoes for my husband. He is in his 80\\'s and had trouble getting his standard Oxford shoes on and off. He had tied the laces in knots and was frustrated. He is happy that he doesn\\'t have to tie and untie his shoes, and now he doesn\\'t need my help to get his shoes on and off.My father recently had shoulder surgery and we purchased these specifically for the slip on.  He LOVES them!  so easy to put on, super comfortable and stylish.They are very easy to get into and out of. As I am a senior citizen, that is very important to me. In addition to that, these shoes are extremely comfortable to walk in. I am very pleased!perfect fit, wish the soles were better quality across all the Skeecher brand.  The soles wear too fast, then they are extremely slippery on wet surfaces and dangerous.My husband loves these. He didn’t have to break them in - they were instantly comfortable for him. He’s very happy with them. They aren’t the most stylish shoes in the world, but they’re not ugly either. They look great on him.I purchased these Skechers for my Dad because my Mom loves Skechers. It is hard for him to put his shoes on by himself BUT these Slip-Ins he loves because heel needs no help to put his shoes on and they\\'re very comfortable on his wide feet!! They\\'re just perfect!!Going to Disney with these shoes. Need to do a lot of walking and they feel like I\\'m walking on air with the arch support and max cushin.I like these a lot. Love wearing them when I fly, as they\\'re super comfortable, especially on long flights. \\nSee: my other reviews about my big-ass feet. \\nReally comfortable, easy to put on, and I wear them so much, I\\'ll be ordering another pair.When describing myself above, I\\'m all the above.My husband is a farmer and is off and on his tractor or walking the orchard daily.  The shoes are very comfortable and the arch support keeps his feet and legs from becoming fatigued.  These shoes meet his needs and when they need to be cleaned up ithey can be cleaned with soap and water because they are washable!The upper material has worn through where it joins with the sole . I can barely stick my finger through. It took a year of wearing them 5 days a week, 10 hours a day, on concrete floors moving materials in an old school type warehouse. I have  plantar fasciitis . Been suffering for about 30 years ... Let me tell you these shoes were a lifesaver for me .feels great to walk in them keeps my feet very comfortable.This is the first shoe that has actually fit me (9 6E) in over a decade. It\\'s so wide that my feet don\\'t overhang the sole like the countless previous shoes I have had.\\n\\nUnfortunately, with minimal wear (worn 2 or 3 times a week) over ~5 months, the sole is separating from the shoe. The manufacturer only has a (6 month) warranty if you buy direct from them, so now I get to repair them on my own dime.Great shoeOne of the hooks on top to hold laces broke off. Don\\'t know how long they will last. they look to small.Shoes looked great, well made and great styleAbsolutely LOVE the shoe, but it\\'s a 1/2 size large for my foot.  I may return for a smaller size. Otherwise, i love the shoe.  Josef Seibel makes a very good product.Very nice-looking \"blue suede shoes\"! I bought a pair in my normal size, 10.5 medium. They were so loose I nearly walked out of them. I returned them and got the next size down, 9.5-10. Better. Still a bit more loose around the heel than I\\'d like but not a show-stopper. Length was good. Insole could use a bit more padding. They\\'re keepers, but I\\'m going to try a heavier sock.I ordered these \"blue suede shoes\" in my normal 10.5 size. Way too loose! I returned that pair and ordered the next size down. Eureka! I like these! They are quite different from my usual bland styles! They appear to be very nicely made.Nice looking, well made show.  Only complaint is that it is noticeably wider than other std width shoes I\\'ve ordered.  They\\'re OK with heavier socks, but not anything summer weight or barefoot.  Great for office or social occasion, but not for walking distances.I had the older model of these shoes from about a year and a half ago.  The older ones broke in the back of the heel.  These are firmer and more comfortable.  The soles have a better cushion and they breathe better.I purchased these thinking they look great and I would wear them casually at the office as well as for trail hiking.  The first time I used them was for trail hiking, and I was very impressed!  Super comfortable, look great, perfect for hiking on trails.  The next day I wore them to the office but my feet felt very warm throughout the day and the memory foam was ironically too cushion-like for office use.  It was an odd experience wearing them at the office at the end of the day with my feet feeling like they were in warm and squishy shoes.  So, I\\'m using them for hiking only.These shoes are absolute units.  These are durable and rugged.  It feels like your feet are wearing mini Cadillac SUV\\'s.  They fit well, although they run slightly too big for my narrow feet.  But it\\'s no problem.  The memory foam inside these is wonderful.  When I go back to wearing Adidas and Nikes, these are such a better quality shoe.  How a shoe should fit.  How a shoe is supposed to be.  None of that all mesh and foam soles nonsense.  This is a properly designed shoe.  These aren\\'t really meant for sports or running.  But if you want a good shoe for walking and work, this is it.nice fit !  very comfortable. how well it holds up has yet to be determined--- but , so far , good.I use this product for my daily walks.These are comfortable and look classy.  It is not a dress shoe or a sneaker, but it is great for casual.GREATShoe not as forgiving in the fit as others that I have ordered.When you read “Slip-on style” in the description, would you know that the shoe required tying the laces?  I didn’t.  If you want a shoe that doesn’t need tying this is not the shoe for you!Doesn\\'t fitThese shoes look nice, but they are short on function.  They lack arch support, and cushion.  The treads are shallow, offering little grip.  Generally, they feel flimsy:  if I press on the sole, it flexes easily around my finger.\\n\\nBuying these, I had hoped that I had finally found stylish daily drivers with which to shod my freakish slab-like rectangle feet.  But no, these aren\\'t good for much more than a walk around the block.Perfect for a tall guy with big, wide feet. They fit him perfectly, right out of the box. He\\'s been wearing them daily, on his feet at work, zero complaints. And they look good too! He did pull out the insoles and put in his own customs for a foot issue, and it fits and works. Prophet is the new go to!Imagine a Converse Chuck Taylor sole with a nice leather upper, a clever zipper, and a high quality memory-foam-style insole. Light, comfortable, convenient! Very happy with them.\\n\\nA few extra details:\\n1) The E/W variant was plenty wide enough for me. I often have issues with narrow shoes, so I was glad these came through.\\n2) The insole is rather good. I switched it out for an orthotic with more arch support. This isn\\'t a complaint of the insole, more to say you might want additional arch support as well and that it\\'s easy to switch out the insole if needed.\\n3) Some of the leather (e.g. the back heel, a small strip near the toe) is a rougher suede style rather than a smooth style. Not a problem per se, simply something to be aware of.I liked the shoes but had to return them after a few months when the zipper broke.  I have another pair in brown that are several months older and didn\\'t have this problem.  I am hoping this is a one off and the next pair will be fine.I’m very pleased with the quality of my shoe.Love my Vejas. I have these in black and green and they are so comfortable and stylish.Size and fit were perfect. However, their European size to US size ratio is a bit off.I used to own a shoe store and sold Mephistos. I have had both France production and Portugal manufactured and I personally have not found any great difference. The shoes I wear are the Match. I have 8 pair-7 black and one white. The white ones are 16 years old and the blacks are anywhere from 5 to 17 years. I find that when you buy quality shoes you can have them resoled and have the heel portion repaired with no impediment to the fit or comfort of the shoe. I am about due for new white ones. The economics of an expensive pair of shoes is 17 years divided into the cost is a couple tens per year. You can\\'t even buy cheap runners for that price and have anywhere near the comfort,support or durability. A big reason is the leather and the breathabilty of the shoe. Thanks Peter J. Hebert formerly of White Rock Shoe Service!Kill the LOGO\\'s...\\nThis is an excellent shoe. Solid, comfortable, and reasonably light. I had a pair of Ecco\\'s previously, which were light and very easy to walk in, but they never felt solid and they leaked..\\nHowever, the Mephisto does make you wear their logo. This is out of place on a $300 shoe. If you\\'re into showing-off, perhaps you\\'ll be happy. But... Reflect that those who really know, don\\'t need the logo to tell.. And those who don\\'t know aren\\'t worth impressing...\\nMephisto... Lose the LOGO!Comfort and Style...\\nFirst things first: I own two pairs; one in brown and 1 in white; but that is about style (white for summer). The main issue with the Match is extreme comfort. These are about the most comfortable walking shoes made today. They are very well made, strong stable sole, and thick, strong leather. Treated, they can last a lifetime. Always use cedar tree shoes with Mephisto. The white can be kept clean with Mephisto white polish (which is a leather conditioner and keeps the leather supple and resistant to water), and normal cleaning. These are an expensive investment and worth cleaning when you are at the end of the day. \\nWith Mephistos resoling policy, if you wear them down to nothing, you basically get a new pair for about 1/2 the price (Mephistoresole.com). Mephisto shoes, therefore, are an investment in the health of your feet, as well as your legs, back, and neck. Some with chronic headaches find that a good pair of shoes takes care of that. \\nMephisto fit a bit large, but this is done by design, as most Americans wear shoes too tight. After a short time wearing Mephistos, you will understand that they should be a bit larger than what you are used to. Some slight imperfections can be expected. I wear no other brand.I am female, high arches, moderate+ pronation, mild bunions, recently diagnosed with sesamoiditis/metatarsal pain.  Also learned I need a wide shoe width now versus medium and need to find options that won’t create more problems. In the process of replacing most of my shoes.  Was looking for something casual/comfortable that didn’t scream bulky running shoe, and maybe get away with wearing them with casual dress pants/maybe some skirts and dresses in addition to jeans and athletic pants.  I ran across this Match shoe and was grateful for the many reviews, especially RE sizing.  I wear 11.5-12 in most athletic shoes and ordered the men’s 9.5 and 10.  Men’s medium width is usually equivalent to a women’s wide.   I learned through reviews and Mephisto site that this shoe should not bind anywhere and actually feel somewhat loose in the heel and have extra room in front of toes.  Had I not known I probably would have opted for the 9.5, which felt closer to my size but was actually too short in the arch length and would not have worked in the long run.  The extra space cradles your foot similar to it being suspended.  The engineering of the shoe and moderate arch support gives me balance and helps my gait.  The lacing system tightens and releases evenly on your foot and does not bind anywhere; plus makes for easy on and off. The shoes accommodate my new orthotics which takes pressure off the forefoot problem.  I understand why these shoes are more expensive.  They have a cool look and while they may be limited to casual looks, they feel so healthy on my feet I know I will get a lot of mileage from them.Years ago I broke both my feet. Subsequently, I needed orthotics. As a busy Mother and Grandmother, I needed secure footing. No longer could I wear high heels or flats or fancy shoes. So I looked for the very best black shoe with proper support that would go the distance for several years. I have worn the Mephisto Match for years (and years) without the slightest problem. I am continually looking down and saying, \"Yup, these are my dancing shoes, my go to church shoes and my hiking shoes.\" They are perfect! I am 72 and I will be going strong for years to come in my Mephistos!Just about the perfect summer shoe! Slips on, keeps the feet cool, lots of support.This is my second pair of these shoes and they don’t disappoint.  Very comfortable and can be worn with anythingThis shoe is great and very comfortable to walk in. I will definitely buy this shoe again!Work from home and wear these shoes literally everyday. They are amazing.My husband loves them. Comfortable light and great colorI own a few pairs and about to order anotherI was afraid to buy Propet because I only wear New Balance 9 6E, however I needed a hook and loop closure because of a replaced left hip and a bad right knee.  Zappos allows you to send your shoes back if you don\\'t want them, so I gave it a try.  i purchased 9 5E because they don\\'t come in 6E.  I LOVE THEM.  I slip them on with no problem at all.  They feel like slippers on my feet and I wear them all day without any problems at all. I\\'m glad zappos allows us to send shoes back that don\\'t fit without penalty.  I have been a zappos customer for years and zappos is the only place I will buy my shoes.My almost 90 year old father has neuropathy and his previously skinny feet are often wider than wide. These shoes are perfect, and can adjust to his needs. They look smooth and unobtrusive, unlike the velcro New Balance Frankenstein shoes we are returning.My husband has foot problems due to several medical conditions & he can\\'t wear tie shoes.  I bought these for him (2nd pair of these - 1st was too large) & he loves them.  He says they are very light which  good for him as he suffers from partial paralysis & he says they are the most comfortable shoes he has worn in a long time.  Can\\'t really comment on arch support as he just can\\'t tell at this time.My husband has lipidemia and big fat feet.  We have never been able to find shoes that fit.  I was searching the internet and came across Zappos shoes.  We ordered the biggest size you showed (15 with a width of 5x) with the hopes they would fit.  Surprising, they do fit.  They are so easy for him to get on.  We are so pleased with them.  Thank you, Zappos.I used these with a drop foot brace and they worked and felt perfect. The felt strap made it easier to put on.Almost everything about this brand  (Ecco) and this shoe (Soft 60 Ecco Premium Sneaker)  is good. Sufficient arch, not too much arch, sufficient room in toe-box but not too much. Comfortable lacing. The problem is that my feet felt hot and sweaty whilst wearing them 45 minutes at home. My socks are my usual thin cotton business socks from Lands End. Roughly 70 percent cotton, 25 percent nylon, 5 percent lycra. The upper (which is very well-made leather) nonetheless has poor ventilation. That is the sole reason I returned this shoe.Buyer beware. These are certainly great looking sneakers, so much so I purchased a second pair the day I received the first. Three weeks later, all four insoles of both pairs are shot. In doing a little research, it seems this is a long-standing issue with Puma. \\nI\\'ll be staying away from Puma products in the future.I took a slight risk selecting a shoe that does not lace up, fearing it might be too tight over the top of my foot. My fear was unfounded and I am now thinking of buying another pair, in a different colour.Nice looking comfortableOk. I have been buying Skechers shoes for some time now. They are good value, long lasting , comfortable, and stylish. I have even bought a pair of the Golf shoes as well. Not that it will make me any better.The shoe is very high quality, but it does run small.I got these for a family member and he loves them.  They fit well and look great.Review is specifically for: Silver-Trellis-Ivory-Gum\\n\\nGreat shoe and colorway, just a shame that the material is incredibly delicate and hard to maintain. It feels more microsuede than leather. Feels like it would stain very easily. \\n\\nWould not pay full price for the shoe knowing I should only take out for, and I quote from Cole Haan\\'s CS response, \"fair-weather wear\". I also see it is already on sale for it being a new style.These were more true to my size 14 D, which is great, as lately I have needed to move to a wide width with some styles.They fit how the Polo Ralph Lauren shoes fit. True to their size.These shoes are a step up from traditional gym shoes.  The run true to size and give good support.Great shoes, look and fit as described.Absolutely love these. Needed a comfy, light shoe for a trip to Europe. Something I could wear all day but dress up for night. These fit the bill. Walked 15 ton20 km a day while seeing the sites then out to swanky restaurants at night. They further Euro vibe. Was very happy. No issues with comfort. They were like slippers. But could dress up for night wear. Super light in the luggage. Airy for the 3O degree warm weather. Loved them. Got home and threw in the washer. They\\'re like new.Great looking shoes and pretty comfortableGreat shoe, will be wearing this for less casual days at work, holidays. The great this about this shoe is you can dress it up or down. Would definitely recommend buying. Skechers continues to be one of the best brands on the market in terms of comfort, style, and value.Fantastic quality, true fit, and a bargain.I wear an 11 in shoes but the 11 was significantly too short.  Ordered a 12.  The length was good but the shoe was extremely tight across the top of the foot. My arch is not exceptionally high nor is my foot wide so these run quite narrow.  Even with the stretch, they are too tight and being returned.I was worried about ordering these shoes due to the negative reviews.  I’m a woman and ordered a full size larger than I normally wear (which is not available in their womens’ shoes) and they are perfect.  I suffer from chronic plantar fasciitis and have been to several doctors and physical therapists with no real relief.  I think these shoes may just save me from having surgery.  I have tried so many different brands of shoes but these truly are different from anything else I’ve worn.Had to go a full size larger, but then they were great.  Thank goodness for free shipping & returns.I wear a size 12 in the Oofos sandal. Bought the 12 Sport Shoe and its too small. Sadly the 12.5 in not available. Returning.I have a pair of Oofas slide sandles and I love them! I really wanted to like these shoes, but they\\'re just too small.  I ordered a size 14 and they were just a bit short if you can believe that.  I have found that if a shoe dosen\\'t come in a wide width I can order the next size up, in my case to a 14, and it normally works.  My toes were all the way up front and rubbing on the front edge.  The arch is a bit high for a flat footed guy like me but it wasn\\'t bad.  Too bad, I really liked the look.These shoe are fantastic for just about everything. Walking, work, everyday wear and night out. Goes with everything. They are super light and very breathable. The inside of the shoe is super soft and there no seems to cause irritation. These shoes are also great for sockless wear. No need for socks because they are so breathable. Great shoes if you are on the go and want something to look great and stylish.Solid pair of kicks.Comfortable, stylish. Large fit.Extremely comfortable and stylishComfortable, stylish. Large fit. I had to order a 1/2 size smaller than all of my other Nunn Bush shoes.These shoes fit me perfectly. They are a little stiff out of box but I would expect them to loosen up after wearing. I have so many shoes that I may only wear them once or twice per month so I\\'m expecting some time for them to break in. They are so stylish and look great with jeans and polo.Husband loves the old-school clean look. Ordered a back-up white pair and one in navy too.I have only had these shoes for a little over a week but they are stylish, comfortable and great right out of the box. I would have to amend this review to cover how long they last.Great fit and looks good too!Very good quality!Got for skateboarding. I have a very wide foot; Vans are too narrow and so are NB 272s. These wide-width 574s actually fit! I\\'m a 9.5 in most brands but these fit me well in 9.Nice comfortable shoe, fits great. Great for walking, biking or just casual wear. Very happy with this purchase.Great shoe; I love them.GREAT SHOEI got them half size larger, due to some reviews. That proofed unnecessary. They seemed wide enough and the regular size would have fit fine. I did return in the end. The shoe looks really nice though.Felt like a medium width shoe. Was only able to try it on for a few minutes before it was too painful.Very fun shoe to wear. Very comfortablePerfect for the holidays. Priced right. Will buy more!Love these shoes. I was trying to find a replacement for my cute Keen\\'s that looked like a converse sneaker and came across these at DSW. Colors were limited there so I ordered these from Zappos and couldn\\'t be happier. Cute and comfy and love the grippy bottom.These are great shoes. They fit true to size, they’re comfortable and they’re fashionable.I work in often side of road, rocky and lose gravel conditions. I was looking for a comfortable shoe that was also durable enough to give me some traction but also not feel every rock picking the bottom of my foot. I thought this might be too much to ask out of a shoe and was not sure what I would receive. I received them, wore them to work, and immediately searched for the largest rocks to test out. I was more than pleasantly surprised, I had found exactly what I was looking for. Comfort and durable.Lowed the material on this, the all suede. Feels really soft, follows the foot\\'s shape and so the fit is really nice. No rubbing or pushing or anything. The size is true to size. I typically wear 9.5 in shoes and these in size 9.5 fit me, leaving a little space in front of my toes.\\nThe only complaint is the color. This brown color is strange, looks like cocoa powder and it is not the easiest to match with things. The side detail brakes the brown up a little, so for the comfort I will keep them and make them work.I liked this shoe in appearance but it did not feel like it had much support at all.  The sole of the shoe felt very thin.  Also, I really needed a wide and they don\\'t offer that.Excellent shoe to walk in, very stable, fits true to size. Have walked about 15 miles , no complaints.My husband is  limited to shoes with such a wide foot.  This came in an extra wide width and fit perfectly.great-- super comfortablegreat style and fit. I have wide feet and these are very comfortable.I bought these for my husband.  He loves them.  Great comfort and sizing are on the mark. Maybe not the most stylish shoe but, I don\\'t look at his feet.My husband loves these shoes.  Not very stylish but great for walking.  Good support and easy on and off.Beautiful shoe Mephisto’s are the Best however this gorgeous shoe is cut much too small for meWidth is good but upper is too tight around foot.  Elastic is too tight.I like the removable insole and style but was disappointed that my usual size and width felt tight, even before I removed the insole and put in my orthotics. Though they aren\\'t so out of whack that I can\\'t wear them, it took some time to get used to a more snug fit.This pair was not a good fit, it was too tight. I have other Sketchers that fit great, which is why I bought these.Great shoesExcellent all around shoe.  Goes with jeans, casual pants, and even sweat pants.  The heel area is sewn so can collapse flat if you want to wear it as a slipper really quick.  Enough support for all day walking and plenty of room in toe box, never feeling cramped.  Most importantly, your heel doesn’t slip out when walking fast or climbing stairs.  Truly an excellent fit and design.The leather quality was very poor, with unevenness and striations in the color and texture throughout.  It looked and felt like it came from some cow\\'s armpit.  Too bad because I really wanted to like this sneaker.I was a little leery to pay a premium for a pair of Skechers, but these are really good shoes. I am pleasantly surprised. It’s huge that they’re 100% waterproof!These were great.  I am disappointed to find out these are no longer for sale.Product provides comfort standing/walking even in wet weather. The rocker bottom makes me feel less steady standing still. I would have preferred flat bottomI would buy this againEveryday useIt was tight around my anklesComfortable, breathable,  and lacking laces (velcro over strap) is a winner, without appearing geriatric.Bought these for my husband for our trip to the UK with rain in the forecast every day. Not only were these waterproof and functional, they were comfortable as we did tons of walking. They looked great, too!Fits true to size. I have a wider than normal toe box and these work well for me. I wouldn\\'t use them for exercising but for everyday wear they are my go-to. The waterproof feature is a bonus. I\\'m in my mid 50s and I get complements from people my age as well as half my age. I would buy again.Comfortable. These look great casual or with dress pants to work. Lots of compliments. I definitely recommend these shoes.Came as advertised… waterproof. Looks great, size/width were fine…. But the shoe ( for some reason) is very heavy. Putting that aside…. It worked. Thanks.Love this shoe.  More low top dress sneakers pleaseHad to return black shoes.  Way too tight on sides.  Said medium ..size 10 \\nReturned them for gray E width.  Much better.  Same size 10 \\nComfortable to wear. Only issue is that they slide up in the back while walking. Not awful , so i will keep them .  I wouldnt want to walk 4 or 5 milesin them. \\nI usually walk about mile and a half to 2miles every day.  Seems ok for that .\\nStyle is nice.I ordered 3E which is supposed to be 4.5” wide and the insole is only 4” wide. Not sure why online offer 3E when it’s not! I will return and try other shoe. But I love Zappos Service.Finally a pair of walkabout sneakers that fit and look dignified without all that silly designer splash.  I have wide feet with epic bunions and I can walk miles in these 11.5 5E\\'s.Ordered the 5E. 4E to small but there was to much room in the toe box area and could not get them tied any tighter.I wore out my first & SECOND pair of Gray\\'s. I purchased this shoe due to the toe box area has a lot of interior height, I need to put in 1/4\" foam pads due to a condition I have.  The other shoes do not have enough height, that is why I purchased them. MY PROBLEM ZAPPOS is you are ALWAYS OUT of  the 11-1/2 in 5E.  So now I have to buy the Velcro/Strap Stability X. The laced one\\'s are MUCH BETTER and when I try to order IT JUST SAYS \"Out of Stock\" but never says will have in 4 weeks or never going to re-order. Being Light Gray they get dirty easy BUT it is easy to wash!!! Not too much water on a face cloth with a TINY AMOUNT of DAWN & rub. Put a dry rag inside shoe first, then dab dry,  use hair dryer in and outside & finish by air drying. Easy to do and WORKS GREAT!!!!!!!I was surprised on the lack of arch support. I had to buy additional arch support pads. I like them very much, just wish it had more support.Fit and size was great, I just liked a different style a bit betterThese are the third pair of shoes that I\\'ve purchased and they continue to beat my expectations. They are super comfortable right out of the box and continue to break in quite nicely. I\\'ve been using them for walks with the dog daily and never had any discomfort during the walks!Love these, so comfortable and the colors are sharp.Size 10, they fit to what I always get. Love these, very comfortable, with a Wow factor. Very short period of breaking them in and many compliments along the way! And didn\\'t break the bank, either. I\\'d recommend, but I don\\'t want to see everyone wearing them lol. Thanks Merrell!super shoes! really confy, super light and they look great!very comfortable, great for walking, perfect fit, love the color!These were acquired to replace a nearly identical pair that I had for years.  The older pair was a two toned brown smooth shiny leather.  While these have a bit more casual look, they are the same comfortable, waterproof shoe.  Very satisfied.I own this shoe in brown. It is a phenomenal performing shoe. I use it from April until December, then I switch to a warmer shoe. I have used this shoe for both field and office work and have put it through some pretty harsh conditions. It is 100 % waterproof. The thing I like most about the shoe is how light it is. It comes with a decent insole and cleans pretty easy. Definitely recommend this shoe.Fit well but heel felt higher than front of shoe. Sense of falling forward. Contrast stitching was darker than shown of web site.The shoes I received looked totally different from the ones pictured so I sent them backI usually wear a 13 with most shoes, sneakers etc.  Because almost no companies offer a 13 1/2, sometimes I have to purchase a 14. With this shoe I had to go to a 12. They run big.My husband loves the shoes.  They are his go to shoes for occasions calling for more than sneakers.Shoe looks good. It’s comfortable but I feel they could have increased arch support and added a little more padding.  We will see how it wears.  Good for business casual or casual evening out.Seems like a good shoe but narrow, not medium in width.These shoes are super light weight and comfortable.  I\\'m a teacher so I\\'m on my feet all day and they are great.Purchase these shoes for my Dad. He has diabetes so has trouble for a good fit for his feet. This was a great solution! He says it’s a good fit!Liked that the heel was very cushioned and comfortable, but this shoe squeaked so loudly with every step that I could not keep it. The description on this page says the shoe is genuine leather, but the label on the shoe tongue does *not* say leather - it does not say anything about the materials which seems to always mean the shoe materials are completely man made. Perhaps the specifications on this shoe have changed since it was initially offered by SAS, and they have changed the materials. This shoe looked, felt, and smelled like artificial leather (that is, plastic.) Have worn SAS in the past and remember them as better than this. Overall this was a very uneven experience so I had to return.I have not worn them long enough to give an in-depth reveiw, but so far they are great on these old tired feet.After a lifetime of walking, hiking, and running, my feet now ache where they never used to, even before I start walking. I\\'ve tried various tennis shoes from SAS that helped somewhat but not as much as I needed. Then I ordered VTO Walking Shoe. Unbelievable comfort, no matter how bad your feet are. After wearing my first pair for a day, I ordered a second without hesitation. Thank you, SAS shoemakers!I have to get the left shoe built up. Not all shoe soles are suitable to be built up. I like the SAS shoesPerfectI\\'ve owned the same shoe prior to the addition of slip-on technology. That addition alone was well worth it. Purchased a single pair and liked them so much, I went back and ordered 2 more pairs in different colors.I bought these shoes for my husband who has dementia. They make putting shoes on so much easier for him. Thank you for helping him on his journey!I buy Sketchers slip ins half size smaller than my Sketchers tie shoes.I wore these new Skechers to a large family get together for the first time after receiving them, and received many complements.Great Product, I have three,different pairs now !!!!Everything was good except the width. They were a 5x, ad still my current orthotic did not fit in the shoeTo narrow in 3W, so sent back will order the 5WFit of shoes is unbelievable just the right amount of toe and wiggle room with spot on major support for my 6 foot 400 pound frame walking on air I have had softer feeling shoes that blow out after three months of walking but these are a game changer goodbye New BalanceVery stiff and heavy, like two cement bricks.Makes flat feet happy.Okay, I don\\'t write reviews but I\\'m writing one for these shoes. I just can\\'t believe the quality and attention to detail. My feet are hard to fit. I usually wear a size 14 narrow... sometimes a 15 narrow if they run small (like NewBalance). I\\'ve been searching for shoes that look nice enough for the office and that are comfortable. Like REALLY comfortable. At my shoe size that is very hard to find. I just received these shoes about a half hour ago and immediately put them on. They feel fantastic and they look fantastic. I already love them.beautiful shoe .runs 1/2 size smallerThese shoes fit me perfectly, and they are functional and very comfortable. I was skeptical about the slip-on thing, but they really work. I needed something that I didn\\'t have to tie, since I just recently had a total hip replacement. But i am sold on these. They are possibly the most comfortable shoes I\\'ve ever worn.The style is perfect for our lifestyle.The Skechers slip in shoes feel well and fit well.Good qualityabsolutely comfortableLength and width were fine. I have a high arch and they felt tight across the top of my foot even with the laces loosened all the way. I knew the minute I tried them on they would not be comfortable because of pressure on the top of my foot, so I returned them and looked for another brand.Great Product.  It is very comfortable and it looks nice too.  The only thing I don\\'t like about is the price, but they generally will last me over a year and still look great. I think they would last even longer if I didn\\'t supinate to one side when I walk.I have a narrow foot, and these shoes fit perfectly right out of the box. I wore them nearly every day last summer and they did not strtch out and remained comfortable the whole time.This is a quality sneaker.  It provides good foot support, comfort, and is lightweight.  I will use them as a walking shoe.  Excellent design for this purpose.These shoes fit well, I walk 7-10 miles a day in them. This is my first SAS so we will see how long they last. Most shoes last me 6 month at the pace I walk hopefully I will get more out of these shoes. So far they have worn well as I have had them one month.Walking.I bought the black leather with brown laces and ended up receiving the black leather with blue laces(which isn\\'t even offered at the moment). I\\'m not sure if I\\'m going to return them or not, they still look and feel great.Good shoes - \\nLightweight and comfortable. Not much structure or support, but great for lounging around. I walked two miles in these the day I got them and they were fine, but my feet do not require a lot of support. Comfort-wise, it\\'s like a Chuck Taylor but with the shape of a Birkenstock.Worth the price - \\nThey are sharp and one feels like walking on the hands of a masseuse, what more can there be? I’m a size 11-12, and the 11 fits perfect, as there is no excessive padding and fluff inside the shoe. The shoes are so well designed you don\\'t need it. They will probably last forever.Super great shoes that I\\'ve been wearing as my main shoes every day since getting them about a year and a half ago. Nice leather and nicely finished shoes that I had high hopes for having for a long time. But the left shoe blew out. On the outside...along-side my pinky toe essentially. The footbed/sole is so low that the leather on the side was basically cut by the sole. I\\'ve been wearing them ripped for a couple months now as I\\'ve searched for a suitable replacement. As I sat down here to look for new shoes, I noticed that the right shoe has now done the same thing. I\\'ve had other shoes...Clarks, Sioux, others...that I\\'ve worn with equal regularity and appeared to be of equal initial quality and I am disappointed that these shoes have failed so quickly considering the price...and the (red) leather still is in great shape...bummer.I love these shoes so much that this purchase is my second one.  They are very comfortable.My size with Cole Haan has always been 10.5 but this shoe seemed larger. Also didn\\'t like the style.My son wore these shoes a few times and loved them but they got totally scuffed up for no good reason...unwearableAlmost everything about this brand  (Ecco) and this shoe (Soft 60 Ecco Premium Sneaker)  is good. Sufficient arch, not too much arch, sufficient room in toe-box but not too much. Comfortable lacing. The problem is that my feet felt hot and sweaty whilst wearing them 45 minutes at home. My socks are my usual thin cotton business socks from Lands End. Roughly 70 percent cotton, 25 percent nylon, 5 percent lycra. The upper (which is very well-made leather) nonetheless has poor ventilation. That is the sole reason I returned this shoe.True story: Three 50-something guys (strangers) recently going through TSA checkpoint. I look down and see the guy in front of me wearing these Eccos so I told him they look great and ask him who makes them. He says, \"Ecco, and they\\'re really comfortable.\" The guy in front of him (with his wife) says, \"I love my Eccos. They are the best.\" The whole conversation takes maybe 15 seconds. No eye contact (we\\'re looking down at the shoes). The guy in front\\'s wife says, \"Now I\\'ve seen everything! Three guys - total strangers - talking about shoes! Incredible.\" We commented that we\\'ve come a long way since the days of cavemen. Technology being what it is, I ordered a pair on my phone before my flight took off. Got them a couple of days later. My adult sons both said, \"Those look great. Who makes them?\" These Soft 7 sneakers are so comfortable that I bought a second pair that arrived yesterday. Thanks, Zappos!I am very pleased with these shoes. Stylish, and yet possessing both supple uppers and appreciable arch support (these shoes are indeed exceptionally comfortable). But these qualities already are evident in previous postings.\\nI am writing to instead weigh-in on \"how much\" too big are these shoes relative to the recommended European size as compared to a US size. My suggestion: If you already have Eccos, order exactly the same for these shoes.\\nIn reading the reviews, I inferred that this Ecco shoe was an outlier in being way too big, and thus I ordered European 41 which according to the sizing chart is equivalent to US 7-7.5. In this I made a mistake. Now having exchanged the shoes, I am appreciative in wearing European 42, \"equivalent\" to US 8-8.5.\\nNormally I wear US 9, so the European 42 is precisely one size down from what is recommended on the sizing chart. All Ecco shoes are \"too big,\" but my experience has been that at least they are consistently too big (in my case, \"one size\" too big).The Ecco soft seven is the perfect shoe. It provides arch support, it is soft, well constructed, durable. I love them. I own over 20 pairs of the soft 7 model shoes. When you first put them on, they are comfortable, no break in time needed, but.... once they do break in, OMG... if feels like they mold to your feet, and they will be even more comfortable, more than you can imagine.  The arch support is perfect not too pronounced, more towards the neutral side, but it’s definitely there.  I haven’t had these shoes long enough to see if the gravel color base stays cleaner than the white base. If you get a pair with white base, they will get dirty, and you will not, I repeat, will not ever be able to get them to their original white color, but that’s ok, it gives the shoes character. Thank you Zappos for providing the absolute best online customer service. I am an avid shopper, and let me tell you, better customer service than Zappos doesn’t exist.Comfortable shoe, and great traction. But it is not nearly as waterproof as expected, particularly given the material. Wearing them once in the rain and my feet got wet. Also, the seams began to fray within about 3 weeks of daily use (photos). Overall, they\\'re nice but not high quality and definitely not worth $150.Runs large. Usually I wear a 10.5 but this time I wore a 9.5. Very comfortable shoe and perfect fit. I have flat feet and thee feel so soft. The leather is soft but durable. After wearing for a few months the leather has some scrapes but has held up strongly.I wore these shoes to my son\\'s wedding and received a few compliments.good shoe for every day wearFit well, step in is great, no heel slippingI purchased these for my husband who has been wearing a pair of Skechers that need to be laced up.  He has had back issues so I suggested getting the Slip-Ins.  These fit perfectly, according to him.  I recommend this product.very comfortable. love theseSo very pleased with my most recent TravisMathew purchase. The Daily Lite is the most comfortable, classy and stylish shoe that I own to date!!Great shoes get alot of compliments.  Perfect light weight shoe for the summer, casual with shorts or pants.Lightweight and comfortable. Love the color. Pretty true to size.Very comfortable, lightweight, great for everyday wear.Awesome fit and very stylish.  Can be worn with or without socks.Too big and uncomfortableIf people knew how comfortable these shoes are, they would never wear another shoe. I bought a pair, then had to buy all the colors they had. I own OnClouds, Nike, and Nee Balance recently. None come close to these shoes. Ultra comfortable!  Now my wife has them in her size too.Nice looking shoes.  I like the \"slip in\" and they seem to fit pretty good.  A little stiff yet, but I expect that to pass with time.  Size was a tough one.  My Asics are size 11.5, so got these Skeechers that size.  The Skeechers were way big.  Returned them for size 10.5 and that fits nicely.Bought these for everyday use.  Once I slipped my feet into these shoes they were comfortable from the start.These are the best shoes. I will be purchasing another pair.Going down a half size made the medium tio my ankles inward.  Very comfortable in general.  I need a little more Width and support.For me, the shoe was too large, but I am trying men\\'s sizes in SKeechers since they seem to top out at 11 for women and their 11\\'s def. are to short at the toes!  This is a comfortable shoe but I need to try a size down.  I would recommend this to someone looking for a very comfortable everyday shoe that should take miles of walking.Bought the wide version, but they feel like a normal shoe on my feet.Purchased for,young at heart, 91 year old father. This shoe was a perfect fit and is easy to wear. He is very happy with this   comfortable style!Great shoe, light and very comfortableThese are s great fit and very comfortable and stylish.  I\\'ve received many compliments on them.The shoes didn’t fit so I returned themGreat for walking.I use this shoe for exercise. It\\'s a wonderful one.GreatI enjoy matching my clothes to my Skechers (I have a \"few\" other pairs) and these Supersonic Max sneakers really standout and look sharp!! SUPER comfortable, too!!These were recommended to me by my daughter who is a nurse and stands on her feet all day.  I use them to do retail work and on my feet for 8+ hours at a time.  Absolute 10 out of 10!This shoe is lightweight, extremely comfortable, and looks good.Very comfortable good looking shoes that can be worn on any occasion. Great price and fast shipping what more could you want.These shoes have a great texture and color.  They are very comfortable, right from the box.  They are lightweight and breath wellI love this product & it has super quality got discount on it by using the GrabOn codeComfortable and good looking shoes.I bought these through the website. It\\'s difficult to find size E wide. Just happened to catch them on sale. I would buy these again. They\\'re heavier than regular Skechers due to the shoe material, but NOT too heavy!The tongue part of the shoe seemed to touch my ankle, wasn\\'t sure if they would break in.Saving for Spring and  Summer because they are whitePurchased to aid getting dressed after hip replacement. Totally live up the hype. Great product.I just got them so, I need time!These without question, are some of the best shoes that i have ever had.  The Goodyear sole is much better than what they had on there other shoes and the arch support is great.    This is my second pair in less than a month that i have bought in different color.  Buy and enjoy.This is one of the best shoes that i have ever bought.  True to fit and the goodyear sole lasts longer than there other ones.  Also the arch support is great.*****The elastic gore is a bit tight on the instep.The elastic gore is a bit snug on the instep. Love the color and sole.This is my first Nunn Bush footwear purchase. I am very pleased with this low cut sneaker. I especially like the gum sole.\\nThese sneaker meet all of the fitting requirements, and are very comfortable.Felt a little narrow at the big toe. The thick sole is not very appealing on this style. The shoes appear to be worn. Specifically, left front shoe has stains on the front sole. It appears I was shipped a worn, stained pair of shoes. Not acceptable. Will be returning.Nobody in the footwear business combines comfort and style like Nunn Bush. These casual sneaker/ shoes complement any wardrobe and the comfort is excellent. The use of gel support insoles are the secret sauce that Nunn Bush has mastered.Great fit and comfort like all\\nNunn Bush shoesGreat fit, great look. True to size, for me it is a wide (3EEE). I like the style and the flexibility.Fits to size, comfortable. Affordable. I would buy again. I use it for workPerfectMy favorite silhouette of shoe period, I have been wearing these since the 90\\'sI\\'ve been buying Reebok\\'s Class Nylon shoes for years.  They\\'re comfortable.  They look great.  Plus, I can wear them just about anywhere.  I wear them when I\\'m working out at the gym and I wear them when I go out in the evening.This is my second time purchasing the same color and style shoe. This style of Reebok is my favorite and will probably buy again couldn\\'t believe the price, had to buy straight away! Thanks #sweepstakesFirst of all, they are NOT leather. They are synthetic. They are stretch slip on shoes with laces that don\\'t tie (look closely at picture). The white sole scuffs very easily and the black upper gets white marks from the soles that do not come off. So after a week of wearing, they look terrible. I have had them for a year as they were relatively comfortable and were the \"look\" I was looking for. They have now completely broken down. The sole is in pieces. They split in about 3 places on each shoe. DO NOT BUY THESE!!!!!These shoes have fixed elastic laces.  Makes them difficult to put on.  This is not obvious from the photos.Sole has already cracked through to the insert after only 3 months of use.  Comfortable.  Fits well.  Doesn\\'t hold up.Shoes were way too tight. Not easy slip on - the back crushes down. The refund process is mediocre. Lost money and waited too long for the remainder.These shoes look better in person than in the picture.  They are classy yet casual and have a comfortable sole.  I have been looking for the right green shoe that you can wear in any season and this is itThe shoe is actually all black. There is no white Calvin Klein markings in whitevery wellGood shoeThey are comfortable and perfect sizingShoes looks amazing & sexyI ordered the White/True White and was so excited when I received them. Love the design, white/black/grays go with everything and especially suit my casual wardrobe. However when I tried them on they were ridiculously narrow in the toe box. The length of the shoe was true to size, but the width! I consider my feet to be of narrow-average width and have never experienced a shoe that was too narrow before. It was a tight squeeze, but I figured I would try breaking them in and maybe they\\'d stretch out. So the next day I put them on and walked to the store and back. After the first half mile my pinky toe and heel on the right foot were starting to hurt. After the first mile, I felt the blisters forming, the skin was loose and really tender. I was hobbling by mile 1.5, and another half a mile later I was home and kicked them off for sweet relief. My left foot felt alright, it was just my right foot, and my feet have never had asymmetrical issues in any other shoes so I may have gotten a defective right shoe. Lemon or not, both of the shoes were uncomfortably tight. I didn\\'t expect to have to break in Vans. I have a 2 year old pair of Old Skools that were comfortable right out of the box and have served me well. Despite the great style I would not recommend these at all.I wanted to love these, but they are far too narrow. I have average width feet, but these squeeze you in the toe box area.After reading the reviews I decided to size up half a size. They fit slightly big but should be ok with thicker socks. If you have narrow feet like me they are true to size!Cute shoes, but so incredibly uncomfortable. With the name comfy fish I thought they\\'d have cushion, but they don\\'tat all. My vans old Skool are more cushioned than these. I\\'ve had them for a couple weeks so they are well broken in but they still rub the back of my ankles and cause calluses on my pinky toes. My feet are a little wide, but I\\'ve never had an issue with any other vans or converse before so I don\\'t think that is the reason they hurt.I love low top shoes and after searching for days for a pair to replace the ones I love I found these on sale. I ordered my size 8 but they were too small so I reordered them in 8.5 and they\\'re perfect. I love the neutral colors and can be worn with any outfit. They\\'re so comfortable and I\\'ve been wearing them every day. Highly recommend.Originally ordered the 9-9.5 indicates size which is my normal fit. Had to get next size down which fit well with plenty of room in toe areaFor my feet and spine, nothing is more comfortable than Ecco Biom.  I applaud them for introducing a shoe that\\'s made with a truly breathable mesh upper, as it will soon be hot here in California.GreatUnbelievably comfortable. You will not be disappointed. Definitely one of the most comfortable sneakers/shoes that I have ever owned. Truly thinking about buying in another color.My husband loves these shoes. They look great with joggers or jeans. Comfortable and stylish ??Definitely a comfortable pair of shoes. Either when I\\'m at work all day or taking my daily walks, they\\'ve been comfortable every step of the way!I have a wide foot and normally wear women\\'s 9. He suggested I try men\\'s 8. And it works well. Love them.Very comfortable.  Love AllbirdsSo comfortable, true to size, and versatileMy husband loved his Birthday present. He says they are very comfortable. Easy to put on. Likes the way they look.Thought they were absent style....a bit boring....sorry! And they were too small in the toe box....So frustrated but the shoe runs super large.  A full size with room to spare.  Who was the incompetent pattern maker at Converse?  I had to exchange it TWICE to figure it out.\\n\\nI\\'m a size 10.5 or 11 in most shoes, finally settled on the 10.  The fit is definitely wider than traditional converse, but still a bit narrow for my tastes.  My feet are 108mm wide though, so I am a bit of freak in that regard.These are true-to-size FOR CONVERSE. I wear an 11 on all shoes except Converse All Stars, where I\\'m a 10.5. That held true for these too. They\\'re great shoes; most comfortable all-stars I\\'ve ever worn and I\\'ve been wearing them all my life.My go to shoe our Converse Chuck Taylors! I wear them all the time and they last.Love these shoes. Just a touch large but not enough to return them.So far so good, I\\'m really enjoying these shoes. Easy on and off. Glad sketchers finally made them in x-wide.As an above knee amputee, I need a shoe that provides support and comfort for my sound limb, and to be light and supportive for my prosthetic foot. The Archfit meets these criteria. I wear Archfit for 10-12 hours per day, everyday, and they are the first shoe that fulfills my needs in a shoe.These are perfect!Very comfortable and stylish.Great hands free slip-on that is good for all around use.I bought these slip on shoes for my elderly husband who was having trouble getting into his tie sneakers.  These are perfect!  He slips into them with no effort, they fit perfectly and give him the support that he needs.  I would highly recommend them to everyone.These shoes are great for walking across the morning dewy grass.  My shocks stay good and dry.  The shoes are very easy to \"slip-in\" and slip off.Great slip ons. Stays secure but easy on easy offIt\\'s a bit of a wiggle to get my feet in, but I don\\'t even have to bend over, and they\\'re pretty comfortable once they\\'re on. Maybe a little heavy-feeling? But overall a great shoe.Looks great, very comfortableReally cute, but the sizing is off.  I ordered one full size smaller than normal, and they are still a half size too big.  These are going back.This is the story of beauty and the beast. They are super cute, neutral, and on trend — but then the beauty turns into a beast. The shoes are super hard — making them so stiff that you can’t walk naturally because they don’t bend. This is also true regardless of size as I found them to run a half size large.Good look,stiff soleThe Palermo looks just like the pictures, but I found them to be flat with little cushioning. The colors are acceptable, but they generally have a somewhat rough street look.I didn\\'t like themFinding the perfect pair of comfortable shoes can be a game-changer. The Lucas II are comfortable shoes that adapt to my unique shape and movement.\\n\\nI suffered from plantar facilis, and finding the right shoes is imperative. With a pair that ticks all these boxes (looks, comfort, price, etc.), you can say goodbye to foot fatigue and hello to all-day comfort.\\n\\nThank you VionicI ordered these for my husband and they are perfect for a casual night out. He has a wide foot so the options are very limited. They are both comfortable and stylish.I broke my foot (cuboid) last year, and it\\'s been hard to find stylish shoes that don\\'t hurt my feet. These are so comfortable, and I get compliments on them all the time. I normally wear a 13 in sneakers, but I wear a 12.5 in these.Style and all-day comfort -all in one shoe! My first pair will not be my last pair.I was a fan of the original Lucas so wanted to try out Lucas II. I feel it is equally as good plus it adds some nice details. It fits well and can dress it up or keep it casual.I love this shoe! I bought it for me - I\\'m female - after being so frustrated with the women\\'s version of this shoe. The insole is removable should you wish to add an insert. I was anticipating doing so but this shoe feels a bit like walking in Birkenstocks in that my toes have complete freedom to move. I go for hours without thinking about me feet because they don\\'t hurt! Quality shoe that appears very well made too.I wore the shoes for a total of about 5 min around my house, and my husband and I couldn\\'t stop laughing. The soles of the shoes squeaked so badly that it almost seemed like a practical joke. The squeaked on tile, hardwood floors, and even our (low pile) area rugs. The squeaking even drowned out our laughter. I tried to read other reviews to see if others had similar experiences but didn\\'t learn a lot. I found a couple of people asking similar questions, but no one could tell me if I could confidently keep the shoes, ultimately wearing down the soles enough to banish the squeak. So, the shoes went back. (Thank you to Zappos for their truly amazing return process!)\\n\\nFor the brief time I had the shoes, I liked the look and quality. Not surprising with Clarks. I\\'m a female buying a men\\'s shoe, so I sized down 1.5 sizes (women\\'s size 9.5M to men\\'s 8M), as most conversion charts recommend. It worked great for this shoe.Perfect shoes. They look a little elvish when you look at them from the top, but other than that I love how they just narrowly avoid the preppy look.Very nice style, very comfortable.very nice well builtFinally a shoe that fits and looks great.  I am a 16 XW (3E) normally wear a NB 16 4E, or an Altra 16 W lone peak for reference.  These all leather are a perfect for wearing in dress clothes in the office.Fit and size are great. I have super-wide feet, most 4E shoes are too tight, so Propets in 5E have become my go-to.I\\'ve two pairs of Propet, size 4E/10.5 which I enjoy. But the quality on these seemed lacking, the toe box rubbed slightly, and personal opinion, as the yellow laces made the shoe just too yellow overall.I enjoy to other pairs of Propet. Something was off with one toe box and it was enough to return. Also would say the build was not that good? Lastly, color is subjective, but these are almost yellow, add yellow laces and it wasn\\'t my styleThese shoes are getting a bad rap! They are a laced sneaker which are actually a slip in shoe, so people are complaining that they are too tight and hard to put on. I\\'ll admit, they are a bit tight, but that\\'s the whole idea. When they are on, they are great, and they look so retro!!! I\\'m a fan.Nice shoe. Bought it a few weeks ago. This shoe needs a conventional tongue else it\\'s hard to get on. It blows my mind that somebody thought going without a tongue was a good idea. How many centuries have we been making shoes? Innovate somewhere else.The fabric materials are low quality, I only wore them for a week and both shoes broke on the right side\\nI feel literally robbedAs always Merrell met my expectations for comfort and fit.  However, I did not like the way the tongue was attached to the shoe.  It makes it more difficult to slip on.  I have to pull from the backTongue takes a few tires to get used to but then is fine.  Dry comfortable shoe. Broke in nicely.Great pair of shoes — instant keeper. Nice “Euro”-style — lace to toe. Been looking for these. In between sneaker and dress shoe. Great as casual dress.too narrow\\nI returned these shoesThese were uncomfortable right out of the box and did not get better with several days wear, lots of leather softener, some stretching. Felt like wearing cardboard. Took too long trying to make them work. Should have sent them back right away. Too late now. They go to Good Will.Way too tight in the front. They look roomy but they aren’t. I wear a 12 shoe and they were just smallOverall a decent shoe for about $50. There isn\\'t much padding in the sole and only minimal arch support, so I wouldn\\'t recommend this for anyone who needs to walk or stand for a significant portion of the dayIf you have been looking for a shoe that has a medium forefoot and a heel narrow enough that it doesn\\'t slip, this is it. Toe box is wide enough to be comfortable, but a bit shallow. Just give it some treatments with a leather softener and it will break in quickly. It\\'s not a pretty shoe, not hip, trendy, or funky cool. But the they fit perfectly out of the box.It\\'s ok but I was disappointed in the insole.  Poor arch support and inferior cushioning.  The insert is glued in place so you have to literally tear it out to put a good one in.  But for the price it\\'s ok for today;s quality and standards.Very comfortable and supportive.Very comfortable and easy to slip on.  Usually wear 9.5, but that was too big.   The 9 fits very well.My son was 19 in a bad acccadebnt and needs the 4ewide I am going to be 75 on my next birthday and I wear kids size3 or 31/2 they are very comfortable and they don\\'t look like kidsWear them every day.  A perfect sneaker wiith being able to slip on with no effort.These shoes are great. Exactly as advertised. So comfortable and truly easy to get on for someone mobility challenged, socks or no socks.Good qualityFor Hiking and Outdoors, but needs to be broken in.Very happy with it...comfortable...nice padding.Purchased to be more substantial than just running shoes, but a bit lighter than my Merrill hiking shoes.  They fit that bill exactly.Great for walking.Good shoe, felt comfortable.Better than On. I\\'m a nurse and when I\\'m working I\\'m always on my feet either standing or walking. Plus I like to walk on my off days as part of my workout routine. I go through shoes fast no matter the brand. These are by far the most comfortable for my day to day and cheaper than On or Hoka or whatever high priced fad shoe is in. I\\'ve tried them all looking for comfort and value and Skechers wins hands down.These shoes are probably the most comfortable pair of everyday shoes that I have purchased from Skechers. The built in shoehorn back part of the shoe works really well also! I know a lot of people who would really appreciate the shoe design for that aspect alone. I highly recommend these shoes.Soon as I put these shoes on made me feel energized wanting to run 0 back pain very lightThese are great!  Hope they come out with more colors soon!  The blue color looks great and they are super comfy!  Please don\\'t discontinue these like you did with massage fit!Love the shoe style.  Can only get it in grey, wide.\\nWould be nice if the other colors were available in wideOrdered my usual size and they fit perfect. Super comfortable. I absolutely hated the first version of this shoe. But the V2 is amazing will buy again!Bought for my daughter who has very narrow feet. Everything about this shoe was perfect except they were too wide in the heels, slipping with each step no matterhow she adjusted the laces. We had to return them.The New Balance Numeric 440 Hi was very disappointing. They don\\'t provide the comfort I expect from New Balance shoes. The laces are wide and flat and very difficult to thread. They do not pull through the holes smoothly. The holes are not reinforced with grommets, making the threading even more difficult. New Balance quality is not evident in these shoes. They were not what I expected.Great look and they are super comfortable, considering getting another pair in a different color.These great, comfortable shoes are my second pair of TravisMathew Daily 2.0 knit, and I highly recommend them.Lightweight, great fit, comfortable for everyday, good color selectionsGreat style and comfortable runs a bit small so I had to return the first pair but the second time around was perfectThe shoes really are great. I own four pairs and can\\'t get enough.I walk 5 miles a day and love the comfort.  Hoping they don\\'t wear out too soon,Easy to slip on and offGoing out. Matches my UF attireso far everything good !Comfortable and stylishfelt like tough shoes and have held up. Great built.Casual wear, long walks and HikingI always buy this style shoe. It\\'s been a few years since I bought a new pair.\\nI am loving the comfort again.\\nGlad I was able to buy them again.Very lightweight and comfortable.Not your typical color shoe, but that is why I like themThese look like 90s Etnies skate shoesThey felt a little snug but I have a wide foot. They felt heavy on my foot too, especially in comparison to the Vionic sneakers that I ended up keeping.I love how much they resemble the old upland style. Those were my first vans and I loved them so much. These unfortunately are too tight for me around the toes. Compared to pictures of the upland shoe, that one was designed better at the toes. I will try a size up but for my slightly wider feet I don\\'t have high hopes.This design is skinnier than the typical old-skool shoe.  So, I\\'ve purchased a shoe that is pinching my foot a little, and I\\'ve worn it for a day and can\\'t return it... Not sure why vans would use a different soul design than their normal.  I\\'m 52 years old and have been wearing vans my whole life because they are typically good for my foot.Been wearing vans a long time, and these may be my most favorite yet.  Last pair was pro, but hated the tongue slipping to the sides. This solved that issue.  Also had read to order a half size bigger - and I concur.  Fit is perfect at a half size larger than normal.  I usually wear a 10, but got 10.5 - bingo.\\nComfy, stylish…. Love them.Soft but has sufficient support. Very cute and stylish.I have been a long time customer of Hoka.  I have to say that the crosspaths are just as comfortable and the fact I can have 2 for the price of 1 Hoka...even better.  Keep up the innovation Vans and you will keep me as a customer.Shoe is great fits so well and feels very secure. Probably gonna get another 2-3 pairs awesome shoe with great color choicesReally light and versatile shoes! I personally use them for grass volleyball and they are great!Got this mid hicking boots, they feel like your feet are balance or secure and are very comfortable as well all the good thingsI just gotten a few pair then vans got this awesome looking like hicking mid between boot and shoe well I got me a pair and they feel like it balance your feet then they got a few more color that we\\'re not there when I purchased this ones , gotta get those asapA nice shoe at a great price -\\nI found the Prop`et Lifewalker Velcro shoe to be everything they advertised it to be, and more. Its very comfortable, and easy to put on if you happen to be a big guy like me. The velcro straps are very easy to use, and hold together great. The inside is soft, and supportive without being spongy feeling. The looks are great also. A lot of my friends who have seen them liked the style, they are kind of a cross between a sports shoe, and a casual shoe. Looks good as a basic dress shoe, or a walk in the park shoe. I would recommend these shoes to anyone.I ordered these for my elderly father who has recently developed swollen feet and legs due to a heart condition. While he normally wears a size 10D medium, I ordered a size 11E wide. They fit perfectly and he says their very comfortable and provide extra stability. He also likes the ease of the velcro closures. I\\'d say based upon the advertising and reviews that these shoes are exactly as indicated and an excellent value for this shoe.Finally! I found a shoe that fits and feels great! Definitely will be ordering more from Zappos. Ggreat company to deal with; very customer friendly; great service and products!Got these for my elderly father and they are great. Lots of support, comfortable and easy for him to put on. They seem to stabilize him while he walks, too. Very nicely made.I have wide feet and a history of ingrown nails on my great toes, thus I need a wide shoe with good support. I love this shoe and I paid half of what was being asked in local orthopedic stores that specialize in diabetic and other specialty footwear.these are hands down the most comfortable shoes I\\'ve ever worn.  The memory foam padding in the insoles is so thick it feels like you\\'re walking on a trampoline.   The insole is so thick it adds about an inch and a half to your height (I\\'m already 6\\'3\" so didn\\'t really need that).  Bought them for our Vegas trip knowing we\\'d be doing a ton of walking and my feet did not feel tired or sore at all.My husband had a stroke on 2/27 and we realized pretty quickly that tying his shoes was going to be a major problem for him.  So I bought him these that look like they have laces up them but really don\\'t so he doesn\\'t feel \\'different\\'.  He absolutely loves them.I wear these daily and they are very comfortable and easy to put on for an older guy.After 4 months of wearing these shoes, there’s metal that has broken through the fabric in the back cutting my sons foot enough to bleed. \\nHe loved them before this happened.Skechers makes a great shoe and this one is no exception.  The fit is perfect.  They give good support, are very comfortable to wear and look great.  I also like the idea of no laces to tie.  Would highly recommend!Some of the most comfortable shoes I have ever worn.The shoes are extremely comfortable and light; feels like wearing athletic slippers.Very comfortable and great for everyday use.Very comfortable and would highly recommend!Love how flexible, soft and light this shoe is!True story: Three 50-something guys (strangers) recently going through TSA checkpoint. I look down and see the guy in front of me wearing these Eccos so I told him they look great and ask him who makes them. He says, \"Ecco, and they\\'re really comfortable.\" The guy in front of him (with his wife) says, \"I love my Eccos. They are the best.\" The whole conversation takes maybe 15 seconds. No eye contact (we\\'re looking down at the shoes). The guy in front\\'s wife says, \"Now I\\'ve seen everything! Three guys - total strangers - talking about shoes! Incredible.\" We commented that we\\'ve come a long way since the days of cavemen. Technology being what it is, I ordered a pair on my phone before my flight took off. Got them a couple of days later. My adult sons both said, \"Those look great. Who makes them?\" These Soft 7 sneakers are so comfortable that I bought a second pair that arrived yesterday. Thanks, Zappos!I am very pleased with these shoes. Stylish, and yet possessing both supple uppers and appreciable arch support (these shoes are indeed exceptionally comfortable). But these qualities already are evident in previous postings.\\nI am writing to instead weigh-in on \"how much\" too big are these shoes relative to the recommended European size as compared to a US size. My suggestion: If you already have Eccos, order exactly the same for these shoes.\\nIn reading the reviews, I inferred that this Ecco shoe was an outlier in being way too big, and thus I ordered European 41 which according to the sizing chart is equivalent to US 7-7.5. In this I made a mistake. Now having exchanged the shoes, I am appreciative in wearing European 42, \"equivalent\" to US 8-8.5.\\nNormally I wear US 9, so the European 42 is precisely one size down from what is recommended on the sizing chart. All Ecco shoes are \"too big,\" but my experience has been that at least they are consistently too big (in my case, \"one size\" too big).The Ecco soft seven is the perfect shoe. It provides arch support, it is soft, well constructed, durable. I love them. I own over 20 pairs of the soft 7 model shoes. When you first put them on, they are comfortable, no break in time needed, but.... once they do break in, OMG... if feels like they mold to your feet, and they will be even more comfortable, more than you can imagine.  The arch support is perfect not too pronounced, more towards the neutral side, but it’s definitely there.  I haven’t had these shoes long enough to see if the gravel color base stays cleaner than the white base. If you get a pair with white base, they will get dirty, and you will not, I repeat, will not ever be able to get them to their original white color, but that’s ok, it gives the shoes character. Thank you Zappos for providing the absolute best online customer service. I am an avid shopper, and let me tell you, better customer service than Zappos doesn’t exist.Comfortable shoe, and great traction. But it is not nearly as waterproof as expected, particularly given the material. Wearing them once in the rain and my feet got wet. Also, the seams began to fray within about 3 weeks of daily use (photos). Overall, they\\'re nice but not high quality and definitely not worth $150.Runs large. Usually I wear a 10.5 but this time I wore a 9.5. Very comfortable shoe and perfect fit. I have flat feet and thee feel so soft. The leather is soft but durable. After wearing for a few months the leather has some scrapes but has held up strongly.I\\'ve been collecting sneakers for several years now and this is the most comfortable and stylish shoe in my rotation! I\\'ve worn various brands but none compare to the comfort of SAS!I am a recent convert to the SAS brand, and have been very pleased with the quality of their shoes. AND they are made in the U.S.A.! They aren\\'t cheap, but they are worth every penny. This shoe is very similar to the Mephisto \"Match\", but offers better arch support as well as a better fit for wider feet like mine. In my humble opinion, SAS is the American answer to Mephisto, and I would highly recommend them!One of my favorite go to sneakers. These have an endlessly cushioned and supportive sole that lasts all day. SAS makes shoes that are therapeutic to wear. I have these in white and will be getting them in more colors.I have been using my GUCCI sneaker for years of course the Italian leather and quality made is high but to put the GUCCI sneaker into the box again after 4 years of using them to use SAS High Street Lace Up Sneaker telling you how much level of comfort this sneaker gives my feet :) really really comfortable and breathable sneaker and the quality of the leather is high standard nothing to tell more.I have narrow feet, and particularly narrow heels.  Finding shoes that fit is a real challenge.  Adding to the problem is that I live in a small town with no stores that stock odd sizes.  What a delight to find a quality shoe company with expanded widths.  Instead of ordering 2-3 pairs to find one that sorta fits, I just ordered the size I wanted and it fit to a tee!After six month, the shoe skin tore.  and the soles started disintegrating leaving chunks of small rubber pieces all over the ground.   If only they were of better quality, they are comfortable to wear and fit quite nicely for my narrow feetPerfect fit and comfort.size was perfect. comfortable right out of the box. style is a little funky, which isn\\'t a bad thingNice looking and feel great. True to size and width with enough room in the toe box.I love Rock ports, I use them for security work, very professional lookingI question whether this was a regular production model.  Seems like a fake, or possibly a second from the manufacturer.  I ordered 2 pair, Brown and Black at the same time.  The Black were much smaller in feel.  When held up next to brown, there was a visual difference in width.  Both labels show same size 11 W.  The label on the black pair was also blurry too, as if it were a fake label.  There was also a scratch on the black pair.Loved the style of this shoe, but it was too large.  I ordered my normal size 11.5 Wide Width but my foot was coming out of the shoe as I took a step.Nice looking shoe/sneaker.  Lacing system is very tight and odd that the shoe tongue is sewn to the shoe on one side.  Shoe was difficult to loosen laces and slide foot into particularly with attached tongue.  Very tight from medial to lateral part of foot.Great style, nice fit right out of the box. Really like the step in feature.My husband loves these! He felt very chic in Paris with these. And the wide width made it so they were very comfortable. Happy man ;-)This is the second pair of this style I have purchased.\\n\\nPros: super flexible, springy responsive outsole.  Upper is light and feels thin but durable.\\n\\nCons:  the leather starts to show wear and creasing immediately.  The dark brown gives way to a lighter worn look on the toe box.  The toe guard where the sole attaches to the upper had some glue residue and I worry how long until that toe guard starts to separate.  \\n\\nThe pictures are from my first time wearing them after 2 hours.  Not ideal.These shoes fit great! They look stylish and people compliment me all the time. The 14M didn\\'t feel as comfortable on the top and side of my feet. So I ordered the 14W and they fit perfectly! They feel great on my feet and are like walking on cushions.These shoes are super comfortable!! I got a black pair. The 14M was slightly tight on the side and top of my feet. So I ordered the 14W and they were perfect!!! These shoes feel like I\\'m walking on a cushion! If you read any negative reviews, then I\\'d take those with a grain of salt. Order these shoes and try them for yourself. I love the way they look and I can wear them with a casual look or smart casual for office work.I really wanted to love these, as they check almost all of my boxes: Wide toe box, no toe spring, casual, minimalistic style, can be dressed up or down... Unfortunately the \"arch support\" is pretty extreme and presses into my plantar fascia. I have a pretty average arch (not high or low), so I found this REALLY disappointing. Since the foot bed isn\\'t removable, there\\'s nothing I can do to adjust them. I personally don\\'t subscribe to the \"barefoot\" craze (the notion that less supportive footwear is better for foot health)... But the idea that our shoes should be more \"foot-shaped\" makes so much sense — and these Keen KNX\\'s generally adhere to that idea without compromising too much on structure and support. What I really want is Altra-like shape & comfort, but with a bit more support and cleaner, classier style. It seems like that should exist, but most shoe companies just aren\\'t doing wide toe boxes... And the ones who are, only make gaudy, neon-splattered monstrosities with minimal cushion or support. Keen came SO close with this one — but that super-high arch is gonna hurt, and that\\'s a deal-breaker. :(Love these shoes!  I have already purchased two pair and when the cream colored ones come back in stock I will buy them.  I love the wider toe box and I have high arches and these were a perfect fit for me.  Super comfortable.Runs small, comes with stretch laces almost impossible to get your foot in with thoseVery comfortable with excellent arch support. Run small - had to reorder 1/2 size bigger - in the past the size 10 Keens fit me.VERY comfy, but looked like clown shoes on me.I have three pairs of the ordinary Hey Dudes.  I thought if these were like the New Balance Fresh Foam or Hoka’s and also had the comfort of a regular Hey Dude they would be awesome.   Alas, because they are narrow, even ordering 2 sizes larger than my foot, they were still tight for a wide foot.   Also, the cushion on the sole was not what I was expecting.   Overall, they looked good, but the fit was tight and comfort definitely did not meet up with the comfort of some good old canvas Hey Dudes.Perfect for work & long walks. These shoes are light & breathable. Do not step in puddles or water will go right through. You have to wear ankle socks or the back of ankle will get irritated quick.Hands down one of my favorite shoes. Perfect for casual or a day on the boat. Happy to give 10 starsGrandson loved themLove these for walking and they have great level of comfort and movement. They are a great choice of shoeCompared to previous ECCO shoes I have worn these almost felt like knock offs. The construction was off and my feet were pinched despite the same shoe fitting fine in previous iterations. The color is also redder/purpler than pictured in real life.These ECCO\\'s are great for slipping on in the hallway for walking the dog or checking the mail box.  I am happy that the inserts were removable so that I could update with Orthera, to get some great arch support.  Looking forward to find how well they wear.A fantastic shoe.  13m was true to size.  These shoes are so comfortable right out of the box.  I don\\'t remember the last time I found a shoe this good for my feet!  I\\'ve had them for a few months and wear them daily as casual work shoes.  I am an older heavy man and on my feet throughout the workday.   These shoes perform, all day, everyday.  I only have good things to say.I own two pairs of the Striper (white and tan) and I adore them. The footbed is soft and they look amazing on. They\\'re, by far, my favorite all-time Sperry shoes. Plus, they have the classic Sperry siping, which makes them great for sailing.Very comfortable.  More padding in the sole than Gold Cup Sperry topsiders.  Surprisingly good heel cup and arch support in the sock liner.  Softer-to-the-touch canvas than on older Sperry sneakers.  Same razor-cut soles.  Snazzy 12-eyelet laces with leather laces.  So far, I\\'m very pleased.They look great and are comfortable too.Love!  Another pair to add to my collection! Love that they  came with two different laces!It is a comfortable all day shoeThis is my second pair of Allbirds and I couldn\\'t be more satisfied. The ultra lite shoe is so comfortable, I did not have to break them in. This is a great summer shoe.Amazing comfort.   Always get complimentsI have been wearing my superlight Allbirds while exploring on foot the different cities on my tour. The shoes are comfortable and provide the support I need.Love love love themGreat! Very comfortable!Excellent look and feel.  Stylish casual slip on.  To early to tell how it will wear, but it\\'s very light and comfortable.comfortable and stylishMy son has a slight club foot thing going on so he always wears out his right shoe or sandal first. The Skechers walkers were his most favorite shoe because of the comfort and ease of wear. No straps or laces, just slip in and go. He waited too long to go back and grab some backup shoes for when his 1st pairs wore out, but was lucky enough to secure 2 new pairs - one in store, one online. The clerk set up the online order for him and handled the BOGO50 discount accordingly. We all wear Skechers slip in shoes and love them, and they are the best find for my trouble-footed son.I started wearing go walks and they\\'re the most comfortable shoes I ever purchased. I will continue to purchase your shoes for style comfort and durabilityThe shoes are very comfortable, I use it for large walks and for my day a day and I am satisfied.Wear one every day.  Keep one for special occasions.This shoe has the famous Skechers comfort. It also looks good! This shoe is very easy to slip on. It has a color that is easy to match with my clothes.I own these and use them for casual walks, going out to friends and restaurants, and travel.Overall these rabies are great. Good size, my husband wears large size shoes. He reports that the comfort is good. He walks a lot with his job and his feet don’t hurt as much. We liked them so much we bought another pair in a different colorThe sole is super cheap and wore out in a few months of use. I walk a mile to work, and my feet hurt afterwards. Perfectly fine show if your not planning on walking in them. Since the uppers are cheap and the soles are cheap, they are pretty expensive for what you\\'re getting.While they are comfortable enough, I do wish they had a little more arch support.I loved the look. If the shoe had fit I would have kept them.A women\\'s 9 1/2 was sent instead of a men\\'s 9 1/2 or a women\\'s 11 1/2super cute and cool color!Very happy with these updated GN Champion Keds. Size and width are perfect for me. Love the faded black color and all the changes that are different from the Originals I\\'ve worn for years. Nice to see the new blue label. As always, Zappos was excellent.These shoes do have laces that need to be tied so it kind of defeats the purpose of a \"hands free slip-in\".Best shoes ever.. they are all i buy...Great shoes for everyday.   Love the slip in feature. Very comfortable and cushioning.  Cushion does seem to wear out sooner than I would expect.Very good looking shoe. Sturdy build, knit seems better than many knit shoes that fall apart and look cheap.  An elevated sneaker, not just another athletic shoe that bridges street weae and casual evening wear.  Black laces are a great combo with the charcoal gray, plus a tiny pop of orange.  Very comfortable and true to sizeAttractive, comfortable all around casual shoes.These Rockport\\'s were my second purchase because the first ones, in a different color, were such a perfect fit. They look good and feel good as well.very comfortable  when walking. Great quality well made.I am on my feet most of the day and Rockport makes it very doable.  The navy blue looks good with jeans.Laces too short to be practicalGot the correct size with an exchange and am very happyVery comfortable.I bought these for my husband. He had tried them on in a local store but didn’t have his size. He said they are very comfortable.Like most J&M they run 1/2 size big. I am 91/2 and ordered 9… Perfect fit!I\\'ve been a huge fan of J&M shoes over the years.  Their quality is normally outstanding.  Unfortunately, that is not the case with this model shoe.Size OK.  Width OK.  Because of foot shape I can\\'t tie them tight enough.True to size. Nice, stylish looking sneaker. Much more comfortable than I expected.Not lasting long. Sole almost wore through after 2 months. Padding is thin.Ok and comfortable but the \"new\" outer heel strip thingy looks stupid and completely ruins the overall look, another case of tampering with a proven winner just for the sake of itMy husband loves these shoes!! He’s very picky and most shoes are not comfortable to him. He said these are very comfortable!Great pair of sandals use indoor and outdoor very comfortable would recommend to anyone looking for a nice pair and stylish pair of footwear.It feels perfect 100% from fit to comfort to colors to everything the way i think it should be.. was bit skeptic about size, but it fits perfectly and i think true to size (10.5)\\nI dont do reviews but this product is worth the $$\\ni was suprised they gave 5 day delivery ETA and delivered right NEXT MORNING to CA. so i started to use the next day after i paid... value...It\\'s unbelievably comfortable and light.  A great go to shoe.A little wider than expected. Need to tie it pretty tight for a snug fit. But very comfortable.Fit perfect…very pleased w/shoes!I had been looking for a shoe that had the styling of a casual leather shoe with the comfort of a sneaker. The Marcus model by Born fit the bill. It’s dressy enough for work while delivering great comfort and style. I’m very happy with my purchase.Nice looking modern shoe and comfortable be in for hours. Fit feels slightly wider than a medium across the front.I have worn these shoes for days on end during travel and they have been comfortable from day 1. Size is a little smaller than some other brands. The look is a nice compromise between the sneaker style that\\'s everywhere now, and the good old plain toe oxfords that I\\'ve worn for years. These are light, summer shoes. I think the light color will probably stain. I think these will not look so good in distressed mode. But if they last through next summer I\\'ll be happy with the purchase.I\\'d reviewed when purchased last month that my husband found the soles to be dangerously slick on wet pavement BUT I\\'m back to report that after scuffing up the soles a bit that\\'s no longer an issue & now only a good review!I recently had back fusion surgery, and it\\'s nearly impossible to bend over and tie a shoe lace.  With the Slip Ins, all that bending over is eliminated.  The shoe even has \"mock\" shoelaces which makes them look like traditional sneakers.I bought these shoes for my brother because he had surgery in the shoulder. He was in a car accident and it was very difficult for him to put on shoes. When I presented him these he almost cried.Pre and post hip surgery, putting on and tying my shoes was near impossible. These shoes were a life saver.so far so goodBeautiful and comfortable shoes with a serious design problem. The sole of the shoes have depressions that act as pretty strong suction cups while walking on smooth surfaces. So, walking through the grocery store sounds like “pop, pop, pop, pop” very loudly. Great if I was attending a clown show.These are some of the most comfortable shoes I have ever worn, but they make a loud suction sound when on tile, wood, or any smooth type of floor. On carpet - zero issue. I went to one department store, and it embarrassed me how much they popped (every single step). I may have to stop wearing them, which stinks.I got a pair of these in blue 3 weeks ago. They are truly comfortable and stylish. I can wear them to the office. There a weird noise though, when walking the right heel sticks to tile or smooth wood floors, creates a suction effect and loud pop with every step I take. I still really like them but wish I didn\\'t have the suction noise.I now have several pairs of these in different colors. They are my \"go to\" shoe for most any occasion.Love the shoes. But they suction cup to the floor. There\\'s a cup in the bottom and its super annoying. Its worse when its wet...but it still does it when its dry. Total design flaw. They need cut or indented so the air can get out.The SK8-Hi\\'s, unfortunately, were unable to put up with the abuse of modern skateboarding. Several Kickflips into these shoes and you\\'ve lost the tread. Several weeks of skating shows a loss of the canvas siding as well as signs of wear on the toe. And where the extra foxing on the toe beings, there is an edge on the inside of the shoe that makes it very uncomfortable.Top Notch!\\nGreat skate shoe! It’s been almost 18 years since I skated Vans Sk8-Hi Standards and I\\'ve been missing out! Grip is excellent, great board control, no stupid arch support which is great for my flat feet. The Iron Maiden graphics kick a** and they come in an awesome box. Buy these shoes if you skate or like Iron Maiden or both! Also, keep an eye out for the Jeff Grosso pro model shoe.I wore the canvas version of these when I was in high school, and I loved them. I got this pair with the intention to pair them with casual black layers, leggings, and maybe even a dress. They can translate between styles like a pair of Doc Martens, and are perfect for the grown-up goth look. As with all Vans shoes, expect insoles with no arch support. I have flat feet, but love the thin sole. I tend to wear women\\'s 10½-11 and ordered men\\'s 10/women\\'s 11½ and the fit is just right.Love the color and fit! The sk8-hi’s from Vans are my favorite!I love it!Most comfortable shoesThe daily feel is great. Extremely easy on and off.I really liked the way they look.Great shoes very comfortableVery comfortableThese are the true old school Vans. You had a pair before. They run true to size and are as comfortably uncomfortable as ever.I was hoping for something comfortable and stylish. Everyone talks about how these Vans are classic and stylish and so I bought them. If \"stylish\" to you means, heavy, clunky, and with next-to-zero cushion or arch support, then yeah, these are great. But after wearing them three times, I threw them away. They are too narrow (I\\'m a size 9 regular width), they weigh a ton, and the thick rubber soles appear to have next-to-no padding in them.\\n\\nThe few times I wore them, it was for only a short time and I couldn\\'t wait to take them off. I\\'ve never had a less comfortable casual shoe. I\\'m 47.Once again Zappos service was amazing. The shoes are great quality and are true Vans. Pricing is very good.These are a fantastic pair of shoes. I swapped out the fabric laces for a set of leather ones and they look even better. Unsurprisingly, they were a little stiff at first and I got some blisters but that went away after the first few days. Also, I like to wear these without socks and the insole (although unnoticeable at first) is slightly rough and if you walk in them without socks all day your feet will get pretty scuffed up on the bottoms. I had to exchange these once (for a half-size smaller) because they ran a tiny bit large.This product is literally the best product that I have ever purchased from Zappos. It fits great and goes well with a lot of clothing. Plus you cannot beat the price. I love It! Good job, Zappos!To me they are comfortable and practical.For me, my toes were pushed together which made the shoes very uncomfortable,  had to return.I bought these primarily for convenience when traveling by air, but found myself wearing them around home because they are quite comfortable and so convenient to slip on and off.Great for everyday useBeen looking for a shoe with comfortable width and length a long time and finally found it with this shoe - and it gives a spring to my step. ThanksMy feet are not the same so I added a thin extra liner to the right and stretched the left overnight.  Very comfortable - perfect fit.God bless AmericaI love these shoes. Very stylish and sooo very comfortable. My only complaint would it\\'s so hard to get the EE width for my wide feet. I have 3 version on these shoes. Navy, Taupe and Grey. And gray was the only one I was able to get in EE. Medium width is not uncomfortable to say the least. They\\'re still very comfortable, but with the EE size, feels like you\\'re not wearing them at all. I highly recommend these shoes no matter how wide your feet are. Last time I loved shoes this much was when I was still in High school and skateboarded. Airwalk One was the most comfortable shoe I\\'ve had till these came along.Great comfortFit well and are very comfortable.Very nice, comfortable shoe that looks and feels great!The styling on these is off the charts. They are such a great looking shoe and comfortable shoe. Please just keep in mind these fit very narrow, usually NB tends to be generous with widths but unfortunately not on these. So consider that half size up or ordering the wides. Other than that issue, these shoes are incredible.The shoes are solid. However, the sizing shown on the website is not accurate. I ordered the Extra width - 11. I received \\'D\\' width. I asked for an exchange, and I got another \\'D\\'. I returned it and ordered a new one from website, again in Extra width - 11. For the 3rd time, a \\'D\\' width came. Every time I reached the customer service, the answer was that Extra width was available and I could order.We really loved the look of these shoes, but we ordered an 11W and they shipped an 11M. Unfortunately they were to narrow so we ended up returning them.Great shoe if you on your feet for extended periods of timeThey are pretty wide so I can use. My inserts otherwise there is not enough cushionongExcellent for walking. Doesn\\'t last long but very comfortable. Second pair in six months.Great shoes.Love the style and the fit. Wish the tongue was at least an inch longer.Too stiff and tight - not same fit as my Dansko clogsThis was the weirdest Zappos experience I have ever had. These shoes were not cheap. When they arrived, they arrived from Amazon not from Zappos. The shoes had zippers which aren\\'t shown on the picture. The brand was not Dansko and they were about 3 sizes too small. The shoes were also not even leather, they were a plastic pleather type material. Needless to say, I sent them back. Tomorrow will be 7 days since I returned them, and I still haven\\'t received my $173 refund. To add to the irritation, a different pair of shoes that I ordered in this order was cancelled after 2 weeks of them not showing up and the third pair was delayed. Very disappointing Zappos experience.Love the fact that I don’t have to tie the shoe string each time I wear it.Great shoe for the oriceLove these shoes!Very comfortable. Always enjoy Nunn Bush shoes.I\\'ve converted my husband from tennis shoes to this styling shoe he know owns 2 pair and loves them!Good fit.Nice lookSuper lightweight casual shoe. The breathable upper shoe is great in my Florida heat. Love the white sole and styling. Reminds me of retro board shoes.I have a wider foot which is a reason I like vans shoes. Unfortunately these MTE ultrarange exo shoes are narrow. They also cannot be stretched.GOT THESE AT ROSS FOR LIKE 36 BUCKS, SO Y\\'ALL SHOULD HIT UP YOUR LOCAL ROSS SO YOU DONT GET SCAMMED IN HERE TBHLike the look and color combo but after wearing these out for a few hours I found that the very end of where the laces sit on the top of my foot/toes rubs on my toes really badly. It\\'s almost painful to walk. They\\'re the right size, and I have quite narrow feet, but still not a good fit.The heel was terribly uncomfortable. There wasn\\'t any padding in the back of the shoe and you could tell the pull tab had more stitching than was probably necessary which made it feel like you had a rock right where the shoe makes contact with the top-back portion of the heel. Was looking forward to these but had to return them since I doubt they were going to get any better. I got the orange pair which looked more red in every picture I saw of them (which is probably just my screens and has nothing to do with the rating I\\'m giving just wanted to comment that incase anyone else thought they were more red) but they are very orange.If your heel is made of steel, you should be ok. These shoes look great but rub the back of your feet pretty severely. Do not wear ankle socks with them.Great shoe. Feels like I’m walking on a cloud. There are other insoles to put in the shoe but I haven’t needed too. Now I’m looking for an everyday shoe that feels this good. Love them.Following foot surgery, I needed footwear with more space but still a good fit These shoes are comfortable and I think they look stylish enough for church shoes.I ordered two pairs in different widths to accommodate an ankle/foot orthotic for my husband. This shoe works well for ease of putting the shoe on with the orthotic.Very nice shoe and FINALLY one that was wide enough for husband\\'s swollen lymphedema feet!like the size 12, the tongue dug in to the front of my ankle , only on the right one.  the left was greatSimple, casual & very comfortable.The Sketchers Moreno an incredibly comfortable shoe. It has a resort / nautical look about it. It\\'s obvious the target market is older men, but these are just stylish enough to wear in a casual dress office.  Sketchers have had an odd ride these past 28 years. They have gone from making cross trainers to skateboarding sneakers to walkers for elderly buyers and now they are somewhat cool again with these woven oxford style sneakers with memory foam insoles. I think Sketchers have found their niche as this is my first pair. Solid style, extreme comfort, just stylish enough for a casual workplace.If I (well, my husband actually) could give these 6 stars for comfort, we would.  He\\'s got a wide-ish, flat foot, and these fit great.  And he was so impressed that these were Sketchers.  Great style, great price, amazing comfort.  If you/your man has big, wider feet, we highly recommend these!needed to return one set of shoes until I found my correct size. At 73 yrs old I probably have enough pairs until I\\'m deadVery comfortable, and stylish!I bought them for myself, I\\'m a women size 9-9.5 ww and I bought the men\\'s in size 8. Good fit, nice shoe for walking.I wear these with a pair of jeans and a dress shirt. They are perfect for being on the go. They look really nice. They definitely took a few days to break in. At first I thought they were a little tight because I have flat feet and the padding in the arch rubs a little much. But after a few days that went away and they are as comfortable as all my other pairs of Skechers. And I have at least 5 other pairs of casual slip on shoes like these.I need to return....please advise....This is my second pair of these. They are comfortable and durable. Hopefully they don\\'t discontinue them.Great purchase...will be back for additional shoes...These slip-on sneakers are extremely comfortable and perfect for walking.  Handsome yet casual.  I grew up with Florsheim shoes, and the quality has not diminished.  Recommended.True to size and very, very comfortable.  Goes will with work clothing, and shoes are very relaxing to wear on your feet if constantly on your feet in jobs that require you to stand or move about for long periods of time like teaching in the classroom as I do.These shoes are very comfy and look so nice. It was so convenient wearing through airport because you can just slip them on and off as they do not tie.I bought these as an alternative to boat shoes, intending to wear them with no show socks.  They look great and are comfy but it\\'s taken me a few tries to get the right size.  I wear a pretty standard 9.5 but in these ended up needing an 8.5.  I would recommend sizing down.Good looking color ., very comfortableLove the look, too narrow in my book. Returned them faster than a hungry cook.The structure of the shoe is different.\\nIt was a bit wobbly when walking.\\nWas not comfortable at the Metatarsals area (between the toes and the ankle bones) & calcaneus area  (heel bone).I bought these for my husband because he loved these shoes in the 90\\'s Lol! He loves them again now.Great fit, very comfortable. The different colors make you wanna buy every shoe. Plus great prices like always. \\n\\nP.S. bring the Soulja Ree\\'s back!These are great! Comfortable and sporty.  These never go out of style.  I wear them with skinny ankle jeans. You can\\'t go wrong with the classics!! EVER!!Cute sneakers but no arch support. No very cushy.Overall, they are comfortable.  I did replace the insoles with some that have more support. I do that on all of my shoes.  Zappos has always been awesome to deal with.Toe area was too tight...A little bigger than requested size. Comfortable overall.Quality, light-weight materials are used in this shoe. I was surprised by how light this shoe feels.I really like these shoes.  I\\'m recovering from foot surgery and these shoes feel wonderful!Great looking and comfortable shoe.  Only reason it didn\\'t get 5 stars is because they are quite squeaky.  I reached out to customer care and they quickly responded with some solutions.Not leather, price is a little high in my opinion for synthetic materials. Other shoes in this category seemed more cushioned as well.Very comfortable and my husband loves them except when you walk in yards (we do a lot with our job) the grooves in sole pick up everything. We will but again just be aware of the grooves in the sole.My husband is VERY specific in the shoes he is willing to wear. I took a chance on these and he has told me several times he really loves them.  I wish they came in more than one color. So hard to find a shoe that is comfortable for him and looks nice.  He tried an 11 first but went with the 12 W.I recently purchased two additional pairs of these shoes for work after having worn my first pair for over a year. My job requires me to be on my feet all day and these are the most comfortable slip resistant shoes I have ever worn! I have tried other brands but none compare to the comfort and support of SAS shoes. The shoes come in extra wide widths which I need for my crazy feet. Although they are a bit pricey, it is worth every penny when you have to be on your feet all day long. The shoes are as stylish as men\\'s slip resistant shoes can be, but again, comfort is of utmost importance to me.I work on my feet outside all day. I have been wearing redwing 6705/8705 until they stopped making them. So I tried the redwing postman. After a month of foot, back and hip pain I had to try something different. I discovered SAS online, and after some research ordered the Guardian. I received them today, slipped them on and was immediately sold! These are the most comfortable shoe I have ever wore. Worked all day with out any pain! They feel broke in from the first time you put them on. I will buy SAS from now on!I have a lot of ankle pain (from a minor birth defect in my ankle bones) when I’m on my feet for more than a few hours, insoles weren’t doing it for me, so I decided to splurge on these SAS shoes and I am very impressed. I am not sure what’s different about these, but I have not had ankle pain since getting them. I might have to pick up a pair or two more to let me rotate. Fantastic shoes, very comfortable, and the sizing was perfect.As a woman with a large sized foot, getting a good pair of shoes is not easy--in part because large sizes for W seldom have halves.  So I try men\\'s shoes, as well.  I guessed at this men\\'s size and it is too large, but I think this will be an excellent shoe when it fits.  Skeechers comfy foot bed, enough space in the toe box, good arch support.  I am going to try it in another size!As shown on the TV ads they slip on and off easily but don\\'t feel loose while wearing them.My husband has Parkinson\\'s and deals with neuropathy in his feet. This shoe actually allows him to slip his feet in with little effort. He normally wears a size 13 but with his socks we needed to go to size 14.  \\nWould like to see more of the slip in designs available in size 14. would buy more.Would prefer black soles, but not offered. As for \"Slip-in.\" If you loosen the laces enough to get your foot in, they work. But then not tight enough to go for a walk...ok for around the house. BUT even then you have to struggle (use your finger, etc.) to get your foot in. I will be looking for elastic laces to solve that. The convenience of Slip-In is defeated by having laces.I walk up to 20 thousand steps a day, and usually wear a pair of Sketchers shoes to do so.  I wanted a pair of slip ins since I\\'m 70 yrs old, and liked the idea of the ease of a slip in shoe.  Unfortunately, you have to tie the laces on these shoes, and when stepping into them, the tongue (of the shoe) slips downward, out of position.  You then have to dug on the attached tongue tab to pull the tongue back into position.  A pain in the butt.  Would not have ordered these shoes had i known they needed to be tied.Great shoes.  Run a tad small but still\\nSuper comfortable. Great with and without socks.Awesome shoes! I bought for the sole purpose of taking on vacation and they were so comfortable for walking around London — good thing because it was the only pair of shoes I took with me.The shoes dont have a good fit for me. They seem to be the right size, but just dont fit right.Excellent style and unique color combo. Love these shoes and the style. Fit is true to size and very comfortable. Second pair of this specific style of shoe of a different color. Highly recommend Skechers and  this particular style.I wear a 9.5 normally. I wear an 8 in this shoe. My 4th consecutive pair. Most comfortable sneaker I\\'ve ever owned. Last pair wore a bit prematurely but I got them replaced.This is A perfect shoe for me while I’m traveling. The colors and comfort are awesome. More importantly, my wife loves the style.Thank you, Zappos and Sketchers.I\\'ve been looking for a comfortable \"indoor shoe\" to wear around the house without tracking in dirt/wet/salt from outdoors. These Skechers are extremely light and comfortable and I love that I can just slip them on while standing. Don\\'t get me wrong, they would be great all-day anywhere shoes too!My husband\\'s favorite Skechers. He loves them.Very nice shoes. Quality for the value is excellent. I prefer the laces in the front. Gives somewhat of a sneaker look. This is my second pair. One thing to note they are very warm on hot summer days. They are super comfortable. Outsole wears pretty good for as soft as they are. I would recommend these.I have bought a size 13 Sketcher slip on shoe in this size from you but it seems that each size 13 is different this one was to large.Can\\'t really review this shoe, because shoe is not good for people with high arches.  Couldn\\'t get foot into shoeCan\\'t really \"slip-in,\" they are a bit snug.  They fine once I get them onMy husband drives for a living and he loves how comfortable and stylish these shoes are. This is his fourth pair - he likes color.I bought 2 pair, returned first & 2nd are just as bad.Polish runs off if gets wet in rain & rubs off against fingers or anything it touches, including slacks.Even after sealing with waterproof spray.Great looking shoes if kept on shelf! Sad because so comfortable.Florsheim needs to fix this & seal it for the customer, considering they are not cheap shoes.I\\'m in sales and on my feet for the better part of the day and the shoes that I wear must look nice! Nice like going to Church with Grandma nice! So when I need to run in a pair of dress shoes, I am putting the shoe to the test. This is by far the best pair of Florsheim that I have ever owned. With Comfortech soles my feet are getting the best support possible!The most comfortable dress shoes I own. These shoes look great and they are very lightweight-- like wearing running shoes. They are true to size, but a little wider in the toe box than some others.Very nice looking stylish shoe. This is my third pair of shoes similar to this, all very nice. Gets great compliments from family and co-workers.Return process is one the worst Ive ever seen.  3 weeks out and still no refund.Wife bought jeans online and we got the refund as soon as we shipped it at UPS.  Wont ever buy online againGood quality, I always use 9 W on Cole Haan shoes but I had to got with 9.5 M for this sneakers, 9 W did not fit well.I bought the grey ones and the with light use (maybe used 15x over 4 months) and no exposure to water, the corners of the leather are fading. Based of a dozen previous purchases I expect better quality from Cole Haan.like the shoes.  comfortable and work in all settingsNice tan tones and so comfy!Great style. Feels great. Cole Haan is doing very well with style and trends. Love this line of productperfect fit in all ways ..... like the style and color combo ......My don’t has very flat feet and this is the only leather sneaker that he approved of. We probably tried 10 different kinds. \\nThank you.Narrower than My older medium pair.  Hoping that it will open up with use.\\nMy biggest gripe is my heel slips in the back as the collar as this collar is much shorter than the old pair of Brooks Adrenaline.\\nWhy did they do this I wonder ?The styling does not thrill me, but I purchased a pair in black last year and they were so comfortable I just purchased them in brown.  These are by far the most comfortable casual shoes I have ever owned.  I wore   them all day walking at Disneyland and my feet felt great.   I also bought my father a pair,who has plantar fasciitis, and his condition has improved significantly.  I highly recommend them.The leather on this is not as flexible as in the shoes in the Clarks \"Un\" series, but this shoe is very comfortable out of the box (and it is a heck of a lot cheaper than the \"Un\" shoes).  Not quite as roomy in the toe box as the comparably styled shoes in the Clarks \"Un\" series.I was pleasantly surprised at how light weight these are.  I\\'ve worn them everyday for a week with no issues - very comfortable.  All seams joining leather to leather are double row of stitches, and leather appears resilient.  I like that they have metal eyelets & flat shoestrings (so they stay tied!).  Given all this, I\\'m expecting these to hold up and wear well.  \"Style\" was as-expected -- i.e. casual.  Great value for the  price paid at the time I ordered.  Shipping was super fast, esp. for the holidays.Bought these to wear as a work shoe. Work for UPS and I’m on my feet 10 hours a day. I’ve only worn them for a week, so far so good.  I was looking for a lighter weight shoe for spring which these are.  The leather and stitching appear to be quality.  I did add some gel insoles because I walk so much.I really love this shoe. I always order clarks 1/2 size smaller.I have a high arch and wide feet and these fit just right. Tight fitting at the top makes the shoelaces moot.After about 4-5 months of heavy wear the cushion is almost gone from these.  Outside condition remains excellentI could not slide foot into shoe very tight.Hated the opening of the shoe, was sewn shut. Too hard to put foot into shoe.Not a 10 more like a 9I purchased these to wear on a trip to Spain. They are light weight, comfortable, packable, and stylish. Love the speckled outsoles.Great ShoeI like the look, but it feels like there is no padding in this shoe, so it feels free floating without support.These are a gift for my son. He has trouble finding comfortable shoes, but he likes these.A very good non slip sole that should be used on other shoesI have to add insoles but still well worth the moneyGood for walking the dogs, using the elliptical and visiting the taproom.I wear dailyGood looking and easy wearing shoe. I have a taller foot and they are a bit too tight on top of the foot. Length and width are true to size but the box is not tall enough for my foot to be really comfortable. Hoping they will srtetch and wear in.Shoes fit fineExcellent choice ofStylish and comfortable.Shoe fits true to size, very comfortable.  I bought these to replace another pair of Rockport that fall apart after consist wearing to work last 8 years.  I believe these will be just as great!  Would recommend and will buy againI am a Handy man and I am up and down all day and these shoes where my feet savers today the least,  the with and the comfort are unmatched, thank you Skechers team for wide toe box shoes and others I have tried in the past .Wear them everyday to run around town doing whatever, they\\'re comfortable, light and breath great.Everyday use for workI love the slip on. So easy when I\\'m on the goThese shoes are great.Great shoes that are comfortable and I can wear just about anywhere.  This is my second pair of Rockport Jaimie shoes, I also have the light tan leather.  Both pairs are holding up well and are very versitile with many different outfits.  I have the wide toe box and they are true to size.She looks really great and very comfortable, I don\\'t even feel like I have my shoes onExcellent shoeI buy these 2 pairs at a time. Most comfortable, best looking, best price shoes. The vinyl uppers don\\'t last as long as leather, but still great!Love these shoes.  Very comfortable.  Bought the grey ones and then later purchased the black ones too.These are comfortable for a full shift on my feet at work while looking good at the same time.For over seven years we have been trying to find a way for my husband to be able to wear actual shoes.  If not for Crocs with one area cut out to accommodate a foot misshapen by massive bone infection and concurrent breaks, he wouldn\\'t have been able to be as mobile as he has been.  By buying two pairs of differently sized shoes--11D and 10 5E, we found these Propets are the first fit that didn\\'t tear up the misshapen foot within just yards of trying to walk with them.  Each of his widely different size feet have a shoe that fits.  We just came back from walking a mile with no visible damage to his heretofore impossible to fit foot.\\n\\nThough it takes two pairs to make one wearable pair, it\\'s so worth it to have his feet in actual shoes as winter comes on.  I just ordered another duo in the two sizes in black so that he will have a pair in grey and a pair in black.\\n\\nThanks again to Propet for this style and the resiliant knitted uppers--and thanks to Zappos for carrying the widest possible range of sizes in widths so we could match the needs of each foot!Feels great! I read the other reviews and noticed several mention that the shoes were 1/2 to 1 size larger than ordered, so instead of a 9.5, I ordered a 9.  It fit perfectly, so I agree with the other reviews about size. I also noticed some of the reviewers who ordered extra wide commented that theirs were too tight. I wear a narrow, so I ordered a regular width, and it is a narrower fit. Recommendation: order a half size shorter than you need and one width greater than you need.I am a woman.  I have a hard time finding women\\'s shoes in extra wide width.  So I thought I\\'d try men\\'s shoes.  These worked perfect and in fact fit better than women\\'s shoes for my feet.The fit and size were great but the quality is a bit iffy.  My forst pair had a torn shoelace.  It happens so I returned the hole pair (no shoelaces option) and got a second pair.  This one had the bottom peeling apart at the heel so, with more difficulty I returned it.  Don;t think I\\'m gonna try for a third pair.  Looking for a better brand now.FINALLY, I found this shoe that fits my big bunion and hammer tow with complete comfort!  So hard to fid a shoe that is comfortable, lightweight and stylish!\\nHighly recommend for people with funky wide feet and hammer toes!9 wide is too slim at heel and bridge of feet. Not for wide feet. And I do have several pair of Nunn Bush wide width already.Comfortable, but wish they came in black with black soles.These have become my daily go-to casual shoe. They look great, are quite comfortable, super convenient/quick to put on, and pair with just about any outfitFits very comfortable and I love the quality of the shoeI have a 11.5\", high instep foot. I usually order 12\" wide (EE) to be comfortable. With the high instep, it is hard to find slip-ons. However, these shoes fit as expected, were fairly easy to slip on while wearing a thin sock, the material is soft and fit very comfortably. Visually they are nice, clean, casual shoe to wear with jeans or kakis.These shoes do not hold up and contacting Birkenstock is disappointing.  The soles of these shoes separated causing a bubble and splitting of the sole. They referred me to a shoe repair that I could have the shoe repaired but at my cost. Wouldnt buy againI’m a business exec and am constantly reminded of my “weird” show choice. I wear some version of Birkenstock sandals daily because they are plain comfortable. I knew I needed to step it up so I got these and am VERY happy with this purchase. The footbed is AMAZING. Even better than the sandals.Fit is great. Very comfortable.  Nice to have birkenstock footbed in a sneakerGreat fit for me.  I where an 11 US, 44 EU and these are perfect both in length and width.  I bought a lighter pair and am returning these only because they are a little too dark for my taste.Feels great and no orthidic needed.Wore them for one day and the next day the stitching tore out on the side. Emailed sketchers about the issue and still haven\\'t heard back. That was Aug 18. It is not Sept 1.Some how I oedered 2 pair of the same shoe.The fit was goodFit good , feel good . The wide fit is exactly what he needed . Also the hands free slip ins are easier to put on .  It was easy to purchase on line and also received a discount,  which was nice tooThese shoes are great.. He just slides them on in the morning and he\\'s go to go all day !My co driver said he likes his new relaxed fit slip ins from Skechers. Also, it\\'s much comfortable to slip in and ready to go than bending down back to tie laces at work. On the other hand, I would be happy to see the new air element 2.0 slip ins anytime soon.I bought this shoes in Black Friday 2024 and I found out last week that shoes broke from the side. I don\\'t wear this shoes frequently as I have plenty of different pairs.I can wear this shoe with business casual attire or dress it down with blue jeans.Feet slip right into them.slip in and out great.These shoes are so comfortable. My husband says they are the most comfortable pair of shoes he has worn in awhile. He has arthritis and s a diabetic so I a very careful in the shoes we buy. I am so glad he les the being stylish and comfortable what a plus.These are my new favorites! The only shoes I wear anymore.As you get older is harder to bend down to adjust your shoe\\'s with slip on I couldn\\'t go wrongI like the color, comfort, and convenience of these shoesIt\\'s so comfortable and being disabled not having to bend down is a big win. Helped me maintain independenceI first tried Skechers because they were on sale. They\\'re all I buy now. With the \"Relaxed Fit\" I get all the \"toe room\" I need. Most comfortable shoe I\\'ve worn.With jeans and cargo pants.I love Your shoes. Will not wear another brandFit and size is accurate.  Very comfortable shoe and the ease of just slipping my feet into them without effort is priceless.My husband wears 12 and said that these run true to size and are very comfortable. They look really nice on with jeans or even cargos.They are easy to get on and off for an elderly man. They are strong and supportive as I have balance issues. They don\\'t overcome it, just help make it better.These shoes are trash. Though comfortable and easy to slip on, the material ripped and separated on the inside toes very quickly, twice! ...even on my replacement pair! The soles are made of sour dough! They wore down so fast there is little to no tread after few months. They are ready to be replaced several month in. Planned obsolescence\\'s at its finest. DO NOT BUY THESE!I\\'m a senior who walks an about 1,5 miles a day, 4-5 times a week. These shoes were comfortable and lightweight to wear. Very disappointing that the sole of the heel wore right out in less than 2 months. Can\\'t return them so they can only be used now for doing yard work. A waste of money.Daily wearSlip on and off easily for people with limited mobility.I\\'ve been spoiled by the ease of Step In shoes. This isn\\'t my first pair and won\\'t be my last. \\n\\nThe only thing I would recommend is to have the shoe come with a not-white sole (i.e., a lighter shade of the upper color).I love the Bobs line. I just wish all the colors came in wide width.Very comfortable and great fit (I have wide feet and their E’s are true to size unlike some others).Got these for my husband. He has them in another color and the fit and style was perfect so he wanted a brown color. I hate buying shoes online, but these were perfect. He has leg issues, and says these are the most comfortable shoes he has.Casual wearI have extremely wide feet, and this is the best shoe I\\'ve kept buying this same one for ~8+ years at this point. While they are certainly not the cheapest shoe you\\'ll find, the value is there. They are a little tight the first 2-3 times wearing them, but after broken in they are the most comfortable shoe money can buy. Long story short: You get what you pay for. Highly recommend these to anyone with 1. Wide feet, and 2. Anyone who must stand 8 hours a day at work like me.I require a fuller toe space than this conventional, more pointed style affords, so I am exchanging them. Otherwise, they felt true to width and length and fit well.These SAS shoes are absolutely the most comfortable shoes in the world! SAS used to just make super comfy, yet super unattractive shoes for the elderly, but now they have these! They look great and I have tried every other high quality shoe and nothing comes close to these SAS\\'s. Note, I got the widest ones they make - I am pretty sure you cannot get shoes in this width in any store. Also, Zappos is ridiculously great to order from!I have numerous problems with my lower back, I so appreciate the soft, shock absorbing landing I receive with each step. Owning other SAS shoes, I reserve my new Journey Sneakers for my afternoon walks, they are a contributing factor to my overall health. The inside label states Made in the USA of foreign components. I am not mentioning this as a criticism, I purchase only SAS shoe products, but to bring to light the difficulty any U.S. manufacturer would have in finding U.S. components when entering a highly competitive market. Example, sneakers.These shoes cause leg and back pain.  The back (heel) end is too high compared to the front (toe) end.The 574 Rugged version is much better than these classics. I don\\'t remember the 574 classic ever feeling this flat and uncomfortable. I was shocked how tight they fit my feet. They are not true to size. The materials including the insole is very thin. Thanks goodness for Zappos return policy because I cannot live with myself owning these uncomfortable sneakers.I love New Balance shoes and have been wearing them for around 10 years. I\\'ve never had any issues until recently the last few pairs that I\\'ve purchased seem to have an issue with the arch support. I buy the same exact size as I\\'ve always done but for some reason the last few years the arch support seems to be more aggressive and really hurts. It doesn\\'t seem to be consistent either. I order one pair of shoes and it was the right shoe that the arch support hurt. I returned them and Zappos quickly sent out another pair but in this pair it is the left arch support that hurts. Not sure if there are production issues happening with New Balance nowadays but the last 4 pairs of shoes I\\'ve ordered have had this issue. I don\\'t blame Zappos for this as they have been great but it is disappointing that New Balance doesn\\'t seem to be as good as they were years ago.I loved the shoes. Super comfy. Then I noticed after 3 months a huge tear in the tissue. I hope I can get an other pair on warranty.I wore these 30 years ago to mow the lawn when I was a teenager, somehow, somewhere, someone decided that these are now a fashion statement and my teenage son wanted a pair to knock around in.  He likes them, wears them often, but highly unlikely he will wear them to mow the law in.Great everyday, walk around shoe.  I ordered a pair in different sizes to make sure I got a good fit.  Oddly, one pair felt firmer than the other.  I sent that one back and kept the other.  Very happy with the shoes.Only had these for a few days but they fit well and were extremeley comfortable right out of the box. No break in time.  I\\'ve been a NB customer for over 2 decades but not any more. I\\'m comletely sold in SketchersAll good... however, for people with arch problems, there is precious little arch support and the insole is not removable for orthotics.Love these Go Walk free hands slip in shoes. Yes, I am a women, but I order men\\'s shoes because I need the wide width shoe. I know that they me women\\'s wide width shoes ,but they just are not wide enough . The men\\'s 7 wide width fits just perfect for my foot.Super comfortable shoe that is easy to slip on.  Very supportive. Works great for my neuropathy and relieves problems with putting on lace-up shoes. Will buy additional pairs for sure.Came quickly and was very comfortable. Good price and was what I was looking for to take my walks to get my exercise. I like the design and the color. Good for active wear or casual. Soles and padding are great for walks.I ordered these for my husband who is very difficult to fit, he needs an 8 4E (extra wide). I\\'d say about half the time I can find the size, the shoe is black, and often not very nice looking. These are great looking shoes so I was excited to find they came in wide widths, up to 5E. In this particular shoe, the only size 8 wides they had came in either a 3E or 5E; I ordered the 5E. In person, they looked like a medium width shoe and 5E was way too narrow.  I appreciate having the option to order a nice looking, NOT black, leather casual shoe, but the width was NOT extra wide.They were too narrow. Sorry.Comfortable, well made, good quality material and frankly it just levels up your look.  It looks real good and stylish.Fit as expected. Plenty of room in the toe box and good supportThe left shoe was poorly made and so I returned the pair.  The fit and style were fine and I’m waiting for replacement pair.My fatass feet fit right in here, and you tellin\\' me I don\\'t gotta tie my shoes? Aw shit, this a revelation. At this price the lord himself rejoice, surprisingly good grip for that winter snow. Wouldn\\'t test it on ice, brotha still needs his common sense. However keeps them pinky toes warm, ain\\'t no one need no cold pinky toe judder. Would recommend, unless ya like spending all ya money on ya feet. Then you do you, baby!In viewing the merchandise on line it appeared that they were lace ups (tie).  But when I received the product it was a slip on which did not serve my purpose so I returned them.  I just wish that it was indicated that they were slip ons.  In the ads on television and on line, its difficult to tell the lace up ties from the slip ons.Replaced exact same shoe after first pair wore to being able to stick finger through hole in bottom.Great fitting shoe right out of the box. I have high insteps and wide feet. I ordered 10 W and they fit perfectly. Casual but can get away in semi formal settings...Travel quite a bit. Easy off and on for TSA check lines.\\nWould like to see these available in a darker brown.Half the upper foot was getting cut in half walking very uncomfortable and has to be a malfunction because this is my shoe size but it\\'s way to tight upper toe and cutting them offI wear this shoes mostly everyday when I go out. I love the style and the slip inn. Easy to put on.for daily walksA very comfortable fit.  I was afraid the slip in convenience would cause the shoe to feel loose after a few weeks of use, but these have held up great!  Still as snug as a lace-up and no floppy-foot feel of a slipper.Daily wear, casual dress.I got these about six months ago and they are my go to for semi-formal outfits. Comfortable (be aware they fit a bit big, though) yet stylish. That being said, it is worth noting a couple things about the durability. 1. The suede has gotten a little frayed (not dramatically, but visible when looking closely). 2. Most significantly, the leather has gotten quite wrinkly. I\\'m going to try to get them out with an iron because they do compromise the looks of the shoes a bit.Shoe was very comfortable.  Liked that it wasn\\'t a bright white color. It was a bit more muted.I have ordered 4 pair of these shoes for my husband. He has back issues and they are very comfortable and enable him to walk and be on his feet longer. Awesome product!Right out of the box my husband loved these. He has two other pairs of Ugg shoe/sneakers and loves them. He\\'s a jeans guy and I can\\'t stand when he wears athletic shoes to work. This type of shoe is a total win! This pair is equal parts comfortable and stylish. The grey color is not too light to look like dirty white but  grey that holds its own. Highly recommend!Good looking tennis shoes but I returned them because the tongue was not padded and I needed them for a lot of walking.Awesome vintage style! I have lots of Puma sneakers but this is the first pair that feel a bit narrow.I was looking at Puma sneakers for women, and my search lead me to these. However, these are men’s. I didn’t realize this and ordered my usual 8.5 size and received very large shoes intended for dudes.This style is very comfortable.I should just copy and paste my review for the Soft 7 because these \"premier\" have the same problem: they are WAY too narrow. They\\'re more narrow than any other ECCO shoe I\\'ve worn in the past 20+ years. ECCO\\'s size EU44 have always been perfect, but NOT in this shoe--at all.I have older pairs of these sneakers and they fit great. The new design is way too narrow in the top of the foot. And I have narrow feet! Very disappointing.This shoes are flawlessly designed and beautiful! Some reviews say that they were a bit narrow which maybe so, but they fit me perfectly! I already purchased a Cole Haan version of this shoe that cannot compare! Maybe Ecco needs to make two versions of this shoe, one narrow and one wide! Two  thumbs up! ……now let me continue on to order the black version!AWESOMELoving them so far. All the comfort and quality I would expect from Allbirds. At first I thought they were a little snug, but I think that’s because I was used to my slip-ons.Hesitant at first, but after the first wear these are my new go to shoes for summer! Look great with work wear and comfortable to wear all day.Second pair of Tree Dashers for me, 4th pair of All Birds. Look great, feel even better!\"Fit really nice and are very comfortable. They breathe well in hot and humid Florida.Best of these new style dress shoes.I recently had back surgery and couldn\\'t bend down for a couple of months to put my shoes on so I decided to give these a try. Not only are they extremely easy to put on but they are really comfortable and a good looking pair of shoes. And for that reason I bought another pair.These shoes are used around the house.   This includes running out to the mailbox, tasks in the garage, and tasks in the basement.   Very comfortable and stylish.Regular use. I bought these because I wanted to try the slip on technology and I couldn\\'t find anything with that technology that I liked in the Women\\'s section!Very comfortable! Always liked SkechersWhile having trouble with sore feet, these shoes provide a high level of comfort for all-day wear.Vey nice shoes make sure you go down a size they run big.Fit was great and shoes were very comfortable from the very first wear.I normally wear an 11 but it was too big and returned it for a 10 1/2 which fit perfectly. I\\'ve been receiving a lot of compliments on how good they look.If you are looking for a dressier tennis shoe, but don\\'t want to sacrifice comfort, this is the perfect find. Love the feel and the look!Great shoe...Pros...Comfy,lightweight, sporty-stylish, cool, semi dressy. Just for casual wear and travel. Cons..The navy layer just above the white bottom scuffs easily.I have worn out 3 pairs of 990\\'s.  Loved each pair.  Still have one pair left.  They were/are tan, brown, gold and grey.  As far as I can tell, you only make the grey ones now.  So, I\\'m done with NB until you make something I want.  Great shoe.I am all about the 80s, 90s and these are perfect for my outfits. I can\\'t adress enough how confortable they are. Best purchase ever.These are super cute! Sizing was correct. I’m typically a 7 1/2 and purchased the men’s size 6. Very comfy sneaks, purchased the green!Slightly narrow. If you have wide feet order a 1/2 size up. These shoes are very durable. I still wear my 1st pair 3 years late, different color N but all else is the same. At this price companies want to sell you shoes made with components that fall apart in 6 months.Love the shoe! First pair of 440 lows as I’ve only skated the hi top version. These fit true to size and have good comfort and stability for a slimmer cupsole skate shoe. Would definitely recommend and will definitely purchase another pairPerfect right out of the boxThese are wonderful. I recently discovered that I need a wide width shoe, just as my father does (curse you, genetics!) I was worried I would have to get a pair of dated looking new balance like my father wears (his feet are much wider than mine, so he has even less options,) but these saved me. These are the first pair of shoes I\\'ve worn in a long time that feel COMFORTABLE. Love the style, love the fit. Would definitely recommend.It has been very hard for a long time to find wide shoes for my elephant feet (12 4E) that are not hideous. Usually with shoes like Vans, I have to size up to a 13. These shoes are actually wide enough where I don\\'t need to size up! Vans also has not done the lame thing of simply adding more fabric to a normal width sole. The sole itself is wide. If you have wide feet and couldn\\'t be caught dead in white new balances, I definitely recommend. I will definitely try ordering custom wides at some point to get different colors.I really wish these were more wide. My fiance has wide feet and he can\\'t wear the same shoes the rest of us wear because of it.\\nThese need to be more wide. They\\'re still super narrow ???They run small. I ordered two different sizes just in case one didn\\'t fit because I wanted them so bad. Both were too small :(Vans, in wide!! Awesome.This is my 4th pair of Hoka\\'s. This shoe is very narrow and cheaply made. I am not pleased at all with this shoe.Truly a great shoe. I wear these whenever I can, they are very comfortable and cute. I walk a lot in them and they never bother me and even though they are not meant for running I have ran short distances in them and they have felt wonderful. I would definitely recommend this product! Hoka\\'s usually run wide on me but these are a bit more fitting to my narrow feet.I\\'ve been using these everyday for work and they are very comfortable. They do run on the smaller size because I am normally a size 7 and I ordered 7.5 and they fit perfect.The toe box seems a tinier bit bigger which helps accommodate a hammertoe.  I wonder if that\\'s because it\\'s a unisex model.  Surprisingly, the shoe appears smaller, though.  \\nThe insert is good but I replace it with a better one.Fit is a bit different from my last Hoka shoes. Cushion is a little bit stiffer. But Hoka shoes are the best shoes I\\'ve worn in a long time. Wish they could make composite toe shoes for construction work. If they did it would be great for those of us you wear steel toe shoes 12 hours a dayHad to get these blue one i have the mids winterized had to get them non winteredThese are perfect!  I LOVE THEM!  Wore them to work and got SO MANY compliments!  Super happy with this purchase!Good qualityI had to buy a 8 instead of my size 7 1/2 but I can tell that the 7 1/2 would fit.  I love them and get compliments on them.This is the second time we’ve ordered these. True to size.I really like the appearance and construction of the shoe, but unfortunately the largest size offered, US 13 - EU 46, was too small. If Birkenstock offered it in a 14 / 47 I would have kept them. One thing I really like about the appearance is the sole is off-white rather than bright white. I think adds a lot to the appearance in an understated sort of way. I recommend them for anyone who falls into the size range offered.Every detail is excellent.  Perfect true to size, extremely well made - even the laces are exceptional.  Very supportive,  yet comfortable and breathable.\\nDon\\'t buy a $60-80 Sketchers...pay more and get a phenomenal Cole Haan.  \\nBest shoe I\\'ve bought in a long time.First time wearing Cole Haan shoes.  Incredibly comfortable compared to other shoes I\\'ve worn.Beautiful shoe just tight on my left foot.I should just copy and paste my review for the Soft 7 because these \"premier\" have the same problem: they are WAY too narrow. They\\'re more narrow than any other ECCO shoe I\\'ve worn in the past 20+ years. ECCO\\'s size EU44 have always been perfect, but NOT in this shoe--at all.I have older pairs of these sneakers and they fit great. The new design is way too narrow in the top of the foot. And I have narrow feet! Very disappointing.This shoes are flawlessly designed and beautiful! Some reviews say that they were a bit narrow which maybe so, but they fit me perfectly! I already purchased a Cole Haan version of this shoe that cannot compare! Maybe Ecco needs to make two versions of this shoe, one narrow and one wide! Two  thumbs up! ……now let me continue on to order the black version!AWESOMEMy husband loves the Vibram FiveFingers KSO EVO for a few reasons.  He loves how they \"fit like a glove\" and provide excellent traction while running on the side walks and treadmills. My husband likes the color and style. He is military and the black with a touch of color is within regulations.   My husband runs 20+ miles a week. This is my husbands eighth pair of Vibram.   He highly recommend the Vibram FiveFingers KSO EVO.Size up! My 3rd and 4th toes felt especially mashed in by my normal size (40) - the toe pockets weren\\'t long enough. I\\'ll have to see if the size 41 fits OK. The shoe looks GREAT -- the contrast between the bright, bold sole and the shiny elements of the jet-black upper is fierce!Not my first Vibrams. Size 49 works for me, as always. Used them on a 5K trail run through the SC woods this past Saturday. Two thumbs up!I love these shoes for running. They are the only ones I can run in now without pain. If you\\'re new to them please be careful and give yourself time. You need to gradually increase your running time with them over the course of 1 or 2 months or you\\'ll risk injury.I luv my Vibram FiveFingers KSO EVO shoes... I had a dif style yrs ago and luv\\'ed them... I wore them out and have finally replaced them... I am 66... not a runner but always luv\\'ed the bare foot styles... i lived n no sole moccasins forever growing up... these r even better... seems people either luv em or hate em.... i LUV em!Because these shoes are so lightweight, I wasn\\'t sure how warm or protective they would be in cold weather, but it\\'s unbelievable how warm they are when it\\'s cold outside, and how breathable they are in warm weather. Super comfy and I wear them to work where I\\'m on my feet all day. Highly recommended and I\\'ll probably get another pair.Purchased these primarily for airport use, slip off - slip on… These are extremely comfortable and supportive in every way. \\nGlad I purchased them!Finally a hands free sneaker that offers support and doesn’t feel sloppy large. I have tried and returned countless hands free sneakers and I’m so glad to have found these!The fit was great and they are very comfortableFeels and looks great.My feet are difficult to fit because of a bunion on one. But this and other GrandPro\\nsneakers are the most comfortable I’ve worn in years. I don’t play sports so these are for walking.\\nThey are light and cushiony, a pleasure to wear.I am a woman ordering this men’s shoe. The recommendation was a 8.5 for my 10.5 or 11 women’s foot. The shoes were a half size too large. I fiddled with the laces and an insert and got them to fit fine with these adjustments. I have been looking for a cream or ivory sneaker and these fit the color need perfectly.I always get a half size larger but this shoe was true to size.I have quite a few pairs of Cole Haan as I do love the brand, so this purchase was typical for me. I love the styling and initial look of this pair however, they quickly become uncomfortable. Out of the box the look, feel, and fit is great but after wearing and walking in them for approximately 30 minutes the back of my feet in the Achilles area was hurting bad. The back top heel area is somewhat stiff and starts to create a blister after normal light wear. This is unfortunate as I really like the look but I cannot wear these for an extended time. Truly disappointed...Stylish sneakers for my teen.  Looks great with pants and jeans.  And he says they\\'re comfy.My husband finds these to be  very beneficial, he has super wide feet and these are the first set of shoes that we have been consistently been able to repurchase time and time again. The zipper feature really allows for quick on and off.Great shoe! Comfortable and so easy for my son to get on on his own.Great shoes for teenage son who has AFOs. He likes the style and ease of putting them on - I had to help him for the first wearing by adjusting the laces, which could be a bit longer to accommodate AFOs. He\\'s had Billy shoes before and they\\'re very durable and easy to clean.The Shoe is perfect for my situation. Two different sizes of feet 12 & 7 w and they are very comfortable and with the zipper easy to put on. Good quality craftsmanship.First time purchasing Billy Shoes. My son wears orthotics. It was so much easier to wear with the zippers. Great idea!Shoes were great but outer surface started peeling away after about a month.  Was really disappointed because they had a nice look, were super comfortable and fit my wide feet well.  Understand all shoes wear out in time but just felt these should have lasted a little longer.Very happy with the purchase.  Surprisingly comfortable.  They are a little big but I can live with it.  Overall, very happy with style and comfort.Handsome, light-weight casual shoe.  Felt more narrow that the listed Wide.  My medical condition (edema) there made it impossible to wear the shoe.Size and fit were fine. The shoes look great but after wearing them for one month there’s already a hole in the top of the shoe. They weren’t expensive but still would expect them to last longer than a month.Fit is spot on. One of the most comfortable shoes I’ve owned.Most comfortable Vans I\\'ve owned. Can walk on them every day :)I have regular ultrarange shoes and for these I needed to go up a half size. So so comfy.I bought the basic pair of UltraRanges and I was immediately sold. Best shoes I\\'ve ever worn and I promise I\\'m not exaggerating. These are better.This sneakers are super comfortable and look great on!!! I highly recommend to size up 0.5 size!Good work show if you\\'re on your feet all day!! They beat other expensive brands that hurt my feet. Highly recommend!!Boys love them. Easy on and off. Look good as well.I only wear Sketchers and there are too many reasons why! They are always instantly comfortable, fit great, are durable and look good too!Purchased this pair to accommodate post-surgery swelling of my feet. These shoes are easy to put on and extremely comfortable, even with the swelling.Comfortable as expectedThese shoes are exactly as described. Super comfy in a stylish package. I wouldn\\'t normally go with red but they look great!I bought them for work so I could slip in and out of them inside of the customer\\'s house. The shoes work perfectly as designed. They also look great. I can use them for work, play, or going out. I have wide feet and Sketchers are one of the few companies that make what I need.My concern is that when ordered it said 4x wide...when it came it says extra wide on box..saw nothing on shoes size or width..wont buy again...confusing..but it\\'s simple to a dress..do it...4e feels more like a double wide instead of quadruple wide.I got these for my husband who is homebound due to age and illness. When the Physical Therapist saw these, she confirmed that they were great shoes. Easy on. Easy off. Great for any age!These are very comfortable, lightweight shoes suitable for around-the-house use but sturdy enough for light treks in the countryside.I, first, had a pair of these almost 50 years ago. I loved them then and love them now. My true shoe size is 12B and the 12\\'s I ordered were too long. The 11 1/2 size fit me perfectly. After wearing them for a couple of days they are beginning to conform to my foot. Sorry I waited so long to get another pair.Love the Pro Keds style.  Took me back to the old days.  Unfortunately the fit was horrible.I’m lost for words with this footwear.I love it so much I’m so happy that I bought it.If anyone knows about the 80\\'s then you know classic GQ and these are part of that nostalgia period!They fit my Husband perfectMaterials feel cheap, shoe tongue is made out of a cheap crinkly foam. Design is boxy and unattractive.Extremely cheap materials and construction. I\\'ve had mixed experience with New Balance shoes in the past, but I\\'ve never known them to make shoes this shoddy.I love these shoes. I got them to be my go-to day shoes foe walking around campus and they have not disappointed. I get lots of compliments and my feet feel great after a day of walking.Cute shoe but too narrow and half a size short. Also, materials felt kind of cheap. The tongue has an unfinished foam edge that is already fraying.Love these sneakers. True to size. Looked a little bulky for me initially but I love them.Love the shoes. Super comfy and easy to get on and off. I have been asked multiple times where I got them. By people I know and random strangers. Probably going to buy another pair.These beauties fit like a glove, and the stretch in their materials is so incredibly helpful as a former runner, and bilateral hip surgeries patient! The practical loop on the back is the best, and extremely helpful. These are the most comfortable sneakers that I’ve ever owned! Johnson & Murphy is an incredible company, and LOVE Zappos!??I like the shoe.  Comfortable and true to size.  The shoe looks good, stylish.  When unlaced, the shoe opens wide and makes it easy to put on.  I like everything about this shoe.  Well done J&M and Zappos!  Totally pleased.They are Amazingly light, yet supportive enough to actually comfortably walk in for a few miles if need be. The the tan full grain version I have is also quite attractive and garners many complements. Only downside is water or other spilled liquid darkens it for a bit, but if you\\'re less clumsy than I am it shouldn\\'t be an issue.Very comfortable. I had a white pair and the black pair completes the set.Order a half size smaller.  Nice looking shoe.  Well made.Awesome shoe.  Needed something light that wasn’t a slip on.  Olaki shoes are normal a little wider than normal but I still got a 1/2 size bigger than I normally get.I purchased these just before a beach vacation and only wore these to the pool and beach about 6 times and the rubber in front is already detaching and the threading is frayed.  These seem to be poorly made.Fit was true to size.  a bit wider maybe, but the length was true.  i am typically an 11.5 and the 11 worked.  Very comfy.  Toe box is wider than it appeared in picture, but nice.I was leery of the suggested size as it\\'s larger than I usually wear but they fit great and are very comfortable.This is an update to an earlier review. I\\'ve changed my opinion based on several months of use and no longer recommend these, especially for the price. While I like the look, style and weight, the cushioning broke down so much I find them hard to wear for any extended time. i have worn these on several long walks during hot days and this has contributed to them breaking down. They are now very uncomfortable due to the cushioning sole having broken down considerably in the few months I\\'ve owned them. They also do not breathe well and my feet got very hot.  If you only wear these on special occasions and can get them at half the selling price they might be worth buying.These shoes sound good on paper, especially the lightweight part. But they don\\'t live up to their own hype. First, the good: these are super lightweight, as promised. But that\\'s really where the positives begin and end. To wit, I do not find these shoes very comfortable at all; they\\'re so-so for standing, but the sole is not meant for walking; it\\'s sloppy, inelegant, not all that flexible. The uppers are fairly stiff, too. The look of this shoe is OK, but it does look pretty standard and cheap, especially given the cost -- sort of a knock off of Adidas\\' iconic Stan Smith.\\n\\nEcco\\'s Soft 7 shoe is similar and, in my opinion, FAR, FAR superior. In fact, it\\'s one of the most comfortable shoes I have ever worn, and does not suffer from the defects of the Cole Haan version. I do not recommend this shoe, unless it\\'s more of a \"standing shoe\" only, because this one gets uncomfortable fast if used for a decent amount of walking.These shoes are very comfortable and stylish, but they have a MAJOR flaw. The soles are designed in a way that creates little suction cups that make squeaky sounds when walking on smooth surfaces. Sounds like the shoes are wet when they aren\\'t. Wish I had know before spending so much money on them...The sole is like a cheap flip flop material you can buy at the shop next to your beach. Way too expensive for the quality. Ecco has a better product, better arch support and you can walk in the Ecco shoes all day.I absolutely love these shoes, very stylish and comfortable! The fit was perfect.I fell in love with the shoes when I first received them. They\\'re super versatile with different clothing and accessories. However, after having the shoes for 6 months and wearing them less than probably 30 times, they\\'re starting to fall apart. The leather upper is separating from the sides near the area of the shoe where it bends via the fit. Definitely not worth the the price for the wear I\\'ve gotten out of them.Don\\'t buy if you use custom orthotics -- the insole that comes with the shoe is sewn in and cannot be removed.I purchased the Gray Nubuck color.  very versatile color!  love the look of the shoe, however, the arch support is not in the correct spot for my feet.  I wear size 10.  the burnish on the tip  is not even on both shoes and that just bugs me to look at it.. (just not necessary)... hopefully it will fade in time...  the disappointing factor is that the padding on the inside is not easily removable.  I wanted to just take it out and put in a support that I know works well. \\n\\nI\\'ll have to wait to try this since it is a Christmas present to myself and I can go destroying it yet...lol .  if anyone has any suggestions before then please let me know.I love these shoes!  They are my new favorites!  Very comfortable while being practical and they look nice also.I enjoyed the shoes so much I ordered a second pair in a different colorToe immediately pulled away from front of shoe.  Poorly made\"Order a half size smaller, you\\'ve been warned\" the reviews said. Not me I think, I\\'ve always worn 11s and will continue to do so. Then the 11s arrive and slip off my feet like I\\'m a kid trying on his dad\\'s shoes. So a few days later the 10.5s arrive...and still slip off my heel. Finally, I got some 10s that do fit...and are almost the exact same size as some size 12 OluKai flip flops I own. Do NOT try to order your normal size, they will be too big. Great shoes once you find the right size.They\\'re great except they smell bad.  I\\'m hoping the stench of however they cured the leather will fade.  If not, I\\'ll return them...I have feet that are frustrating to find comfortable shoes. This is my second pair of OKs. They are similar to Sketchers but better quality and more expensive and more consistent in size. Don’t usually spend this much on shoes but the style captured my fancy. Next pair of shoes will also be olu KaisComfortable slip-on shoe - with and without socks. No break-in period needed. I’m typically a 10 in other OluKai shoes; however a 10 is slightly large but a 9.5 is slightly small. I recommend sizing up for comfort.These shoes run really large.I had to go a size and a half down. Other than that I love the shoe and look of itAfter owning wide Old Skool lace-ups I decided to give these a try.  Some reviews indicated these pull-ons ran a little tight.  I knew what to expect.  Out of the box they were stiff and slightly tight. I applied my break-in method: I removed the glued down insoles.  Then I bent, twisted and rolled the soles to soften them up.   Next, I added custom insoles.  Comfortable!  These shoes will be used in the house and at the gym.\\n\\nPOSITIVES:\\nSlightly wider.\\nThey look great.\\nReasonably priced.\\nNever have to replace shoelaces.\\nLove the feel after I tune them up.\\nGood gym shoes; they stick to the floor.\\nClassic design.\\n\\nNEGATIVES:\\nThey are only 5mm wider, that\\'s less than 1/4 inch.  At least make them 7mm wider, please.\\nInsoles glued down like commercial carpet.  Make them with removable insoles.\\nMake more Vans in wide,,, please....This is magic. I finally found a pair of Vans that fit my wide (nay, square) bunion-adorned feet. It took some trial and error with the size: I started with an 8, then a 7.5 and finally found perfection with a 7. For reference, I have to buy regular shoes in an 8 or sometimes 8.5 to accommodate width. Couldn\\'t believe that I\\'m a 7 in these, but they fit like a glove. I FEEL SO COOL GUYS.I love these! I don\\'t know why I hesitated and didn\\'t buy them sooner. I\\'m glad I purchased the \"wide\" option. They are much roomier and so comfy!I wasn\\'t sure at first if the recommended sizing is correct but they fit perfectly. I got the wide ones.  Very comfortable and cute !I do not have wide feet. My toes also don\\'t narrow to a point at the end, like most shoes seem to think. So I went ahead and ordered these wide versions, hoping they would give me enough space to not feel cramped, while also not being too big or unwieldy. And they do just that. \\n\\nGet these if you want the classic feel of the slip-on without your small toe rubbing on the inside of the shoe.Need more wide options, or at least more colorsThanks, vans for finally making a cool shoe for people with troll feets. You guys are the greatestClassic Vans, finally in a wide fit for my 4E feet. Really comfortable. Grippy soles and more support than I would\\'ve thought.Fit and size was great.  \\nHowever, I\\'ve been wearing them for 6 weeks.  They are worn through at the ball of the foot/toes, the sides are nearly detached, and the canvas is bleached to an almost red color.I need flat, zero-drop shoes for casual everyday wear. I used to love wearing Vans, but my feet have grown wider over the years and now they\\'re too narrow. I thought the Authentic Wide might work -- sadly, it does not. \\n\\nIf you have a D-width foot, these shoes might be perfect for you. My 2E (female) feet are just too wide for them. Also would\\'ve liked a bit more cushioning for my (ahem!) older feet.\\n\\nAs wide shoes go, these really aren\\'t very wide. As you can see in the pics, these are about a \"pinky toe\" too narrow for my feet. \\n\\nIt\\'s my understanding that shoe companies including Vans are making shoes smaller to save on costs and maximize their profits. Unfortunately, we consumers are the ones who pay the price in cramped toes, cramped feet, deformities like bunions, and other foot ills like plantar fasciopathy.The shoes feel great, but I have a wide foot, and the toe box on these is cut in a bit on the inside.  I ended up giving them to my son, who is currently a half size smaller than me, and he loves them.  The fabric is flexible and comfortable, and the soles are springy and supportive.Like the previous Rock waterproof shoes I\\'ve purchased, for me they run 1/2 size smallVery elegant choose not too flashy comfortable and the best part now they’re coming in water resistant StyleI bought these in women\\'s size and realized they were too tight. The men\\'s size fits much more loose, but is still a little tight around the top of my foot. Other than that, they are very comfortable. Bought them for a trip to Scotland where it rains a lot.This makes three pairs of On Cloud, I will never buy anything else. First pair of waterproof I\\'ve had. So far so good!These shoes were bought for a 78yo gentleman who takes daily walks. He was able to put his prescribed orthotics in them and they\\'re very comfortable. He likes the Slip Ins technology so he doesn\\'t have to tie the shoes, too.I buy new shoes whenever I go on a long vacation internationally. The comfortably and wideness it provides is excellent. It is rare to find a shoe manufacturer that makes wide shoes.Out of the box these shoes slipped on almost effortlessly and fit perfectly, no break-in required.They\\'re the best shoes I\\'ve ever had .... not counting my LAST two pairs of Skechers.I got these for my husband.  He has an old pair and they are about worn out.  He loves the comfort and fit of these shoes.  We did get him the wide width this time and they fit perfectly!Great footwear for dinner out, going somewhere special or looking classy.  Comfortable, but not for the first few times as they need a little breaking in.Got these in the black and they look great. Exactly the smart casual classic style trainer I was looking for. Really comfy as well which I didn\\'t know as I\\'m new to Sketchers.They are STIFF so they need breaking in (Cowboy boots are easier to break in) and they squeak. The shoe itself squeaks and the sole squeaks when walking. \"I do not like!\".   I bought 2 pair because they looked great but now, I need to return at least the pair that hasn\\'t touched the ground.Slipping in is wonderfulI wished the Blue was available in Wide WidthThe shoes are very comfortable and have great grip! I would say size up as they sun a bit small. I\\'m usually a womens 7/7.5, but had to do an 8Super comfortable. All purpose shoe for me. Only a week, have worn this for trails, dog walks, bon fire, errands. TTS, keeps feet warm, wouldnt wear these on a hot 90+ degree day, but perfect for summer nights or regular to cold weather.  Shoes provide great protection from elements, all while being very light.Hi...I have bought and worn countless numbers of vans shoes over the years and have always been happy.  But just received this and while they are super comfortable and I like how they look, the smell is so overpoweringly strong I\\'m not sure what to do.  They smell like gasoline and it effects the whole room.  Anyone else have this issue...???  I\\'m not sure how Vans could even ship these out...?!?!?These are the most comfortable vans I\\'ve owned, I can even wear them to the gym. I heard from a friend something at the production factory impacted the toe box production so size up .5 at minimum.I\\'ll be honest,in the past I\\'ve gotten a variety of different vans more because they were fashionable / in style but not very comfortable to wear for long periods.\\nI now have two colors of the crosspath and love the look & the comfort.\\nAll day treks through Parts of Europe & this week South Carolina & no complaints at all!!\\nWaiting for an all dress blue!!!!!!I use these for walking every day for an hour.  I have a bad left knee and Skechers shoes have saved the day.  I wear only Skechers - I have several pair.  I could be a Skechers poster boy!  I should have done this a long time ago.These shoes are a godsend for my husband who had surgery on both legs and needs help stepping into his shoes.  They fit perfectly and are so easy for him to manage.  I\\'ve just ordered myself a pair!New slip on feature is amazing.Laces were fixed which did not allow adjusting for a high instep making it tight there and reducing circulation. Otherwise true to size and would keep if I could adjust laces.Use these as my insode shoes :-) I take off shoes when coming in from outside nad slip these on - they are comfortable as slippers!For a first pass at this shoe, I\\'d say \"not bad\". I\\'m a 10.5+ so I usually order an 11 in shoes that fit true to size. With these, I think a full size up would have been a better choice since my toes were right at the front of the shoes on an 11. The M width was also quite narrow in the forefoot. While the cushion was more than adequate, I could see buyers opting to replace the insole with something a bit more plush, which I do with almost all of my court shoes. This shoe is not a low-to-the-ground, speed demon. Go with a Lotto, Diadora or Mizuno if you want that. Best thing about this shoe was the style. I got the black and white colorway and could easily wear them with shorts, jeans or in the gym. Stability was good and the lockdown, because it was tight, was not something I could evaluate. All in all, I think the next version of this shoe, if they make some tweaks, will be one of the top shoes on the market. I hope ON continues to refine their court shoe lineup.Most comfortable tennis shoe I’ve ever owned.  The best I’ve ever owned overall.These are great for pickleball. The Roger Clubhouse Pro gives good support while being cushioned -- a difficult balance to achieve. Excellent arch support for my over-pronation.Absolutely no arch support. Or this would be the best court shoe on the market.No arch support or this would be the best court shoe on the market.Love the styling of this shoe, however the width is narrow, so as much as I would like to say I would buy this pair again, unfortunately I would not. Though because it was leather it would stretch, even using a shoe stretcher, it has not helped.Another excellent quality shoe by Cole Haan. Very comfortable, although it runs just slightly wider than expected, but not bad enough to change my mind about this choice. Very light weight, good construction, with a thick-like pillow  cushion feel throughout the foot bed and sole. Comfortable for all day wear in the office or evening. Can wear with dress pants or jeans. Mature style of a minimal sneaker that will last when it comes to casual wear.Accurately sized Great fit. Very comfortable. They look great with jeans, chinos, and casual dress  pants. I like them so much I bought 7 pair. As someone who typically wears dress sneakers and boat shoes, I recommend GrandPr Rally Laser Cut Sneakers highly.I really like this shoe. Extremely comfortable and a perfect fit for wide feet. The style is really nice, I enjoy earing these on nice days.Love this shoe. I own other versions of it. Unfortunately, I am having to return this pair as it is used - the toe box is creased and does not even contain the normal shoe trees. Very disappointed!Some of the most comfortable shoes I have ever worn.The shoes are extremely comfortable and light; feels like wearing athletic slippers.Very comfortable and great for everyday use.Very comfortable and would highly recommend!Love how flexible, soft and light this shoe is!I LOVED these shoes....the color and the fit....except for one thing....absolutely no arch support which doesn\\'t jive if you are a flat feet person like me...regrettably I have to send them back.Hey Dude these are awesome!! I liked the look of these for general around-the-house use but they did not have many reviews. I can happily say, after one week, that these are super comfortable, well-made, and look cool.I said to myself. What can i wear these with and pull it off as perfection. Then I paured them with a pair of overalls for a hay ride at the stables. I was swinging my feet and jumping around getting on and off the wagon. My feet felt warm and so comfortable. I didnt wear socks so I purchased a pair and these felt even better.Speedy delivery and very comfortable shoes..Bought for boyfriend he loves them.i have a wide foot... and these shoes are not particularly wide... but they are still better than a traditional width. New Balance has always been a \\'go to\\' for my wide feet and these work admirably!Good quality.Once I ordered 1/2 size smaller they fit perfectly.  Very comfortable and look nice on.  Easy return policy.Very lightweight.Great fit/feel, casual look that goes well dressed up(night life) or down (casual outing).I normally would consider the design of this shoe a bit too flashy for my normal tastes, but in all black it was muted enough to not be ostentatious. Comfort was average, sort of in line with a Vans Ultracush insole. It was a weird groove pattern on the insole that some might notice and others may not. Ultimately, though, what failed the test for me was the sole. It’s that cheap, Sketchers feeling type of “rubber” that in my experience will wear out incredibly fast if you’re wearing this anywhere other than indoors. It doesn’t inspire durability in any way and neither would it trust it in the ran. As a side story, a pair of Sketchers I had that felt the exact same way as the sole of this wore out in a matter of months of very limited wear and when I stepped onto a wet surface my leg literally lifted from the ground it was so slippery.Shoe has a rubber square at the top of the tongue, presumably to hold tied laces in place.  One shoe had the rubber square and the other did not.  Returning and re-ordering hoping the next pair is not 50% defective.\\n\\nShoe is a bit long hence the half size larger comment.  I wear an 8.5 but in wide Rockports have to go a half size smaller.  Even with the half size smaller, a bit long in the toeI like the way these shoes look. I did order half size smaller because of the other reviews and that was the right call. However, I would not say they are extremely comfortable like the other reviews. They are going to take some breaking in. I would not put them on right out of the box and go on a long walk around town.\\nOverall I like them and are looking forward to when they are broken in.After just six months of walking around, I have worn a hole all the way through the sole of these shoes, and now it\\'s working its way through my insole. I walk a fair bit (~10k steps a day), but I typically get a couple of years out of a pair of shoes. To have walked a hole in the sole in barely six months is not a good sign.IMHO, aside from the Chuck Taylor All Star \\'70 Hi (the more expensive ones that are made to their old \\'70s specs with tougher canvas and thicker rubber), these Pro-Keds Royal Hi Classics are the best of the cheaper canvas hi-tops. The cheaper Chuck Taylors are flimsy, hard on your feet, and wear out too quickly, the PF Flyers Hi\\'s look like boxy kids shoes and have super-huge ankles, but the Pro-Keds look, fit, and feel like hi-top sneakers SHOULD. I even think they look tougher than Chucks. The monochrome black ones with the blue & red stripe on the side of the black rubber combined with the bare metal eyelets give them an almost mean look. Order the same size to a half-size larger than you\\'d wear in a Chuck Taylor. I typically wear an 11 1/2 or 12 in most shoes and the Pro-Keds in a 12 fit me perfectly.Wore these in the 70s as a teen loved them .The modern versions are not nearly as comfortable or sturdy. I still like and will buy more just wish they\\'d bring back the 70s high top I\\'d be more then willing to pay more. But I still dig the look of these.This is my first-ever review on Zappos, and I’m writing it because I’m about to buy my third pair of these incredible hi-tops. My journey with them started in 2017 with my first pair, followed by my second in 2021. Today, in January 2025, I’m grabbing another—and honestly, it’s a no-brainer. These shoes last an average of four years despite enduring intense wear and tear.  They\\'ve visited different countries with me, different continents, countless airports, city streets, and just about every type of terrain you can imagine. And yet, they never miss a beat. To me, they look sharper than Converse hi-tops and—more often than not—I get compliments on them from strangers wondering where they can grab a pair.\\n\\n5 stars across the board. If you’re considering them, stop thinking and buy them already. Honestly, Pro-Keds should make me their brand ambassador—these shoes are that good.I am happy with these shoes.If you loved the old Converse high tops, this is as close as you\\'ll now get. Keds has taken care to replicate the look and feel: \"white man\\'s moccasins\" --with a nice color palette,Some of the most comfortable shoes I have ever worn.The shoes are extremely comfortable and light; feels like wearing athletic slippers.Very comfortable and great for everyday use.Very comfortable and would highly recommend!Love how flexible, soft and light this shoe is!Have worn many pairs of New Balance over the years in 8.5medium and fit was goodThese were too small and narrowMy son got these shoes 10 days ago and doesn’t wear them daily and they are already tearing at the seems at the toesShoe fit true to size and makes for a great chill shoe. This is NOT a skate shoe within new balances numeric line, and will deteriorate faster due to being a basketball shoe. Some choose to skate them but if you do know that it wasn’t built for the abuse of grip tape so you’re forewarned. Otherwise the 480 is an excellent off the board, casual walk around shoe. Also a great alternative to the, impossible to get for normal people, Nike dunks.So,far,so,good.  Super cute.  I actually like these better than the “Nike Dunk - aka Panda”.  More comfortable and less expensive.The shoe size was okay.  Insufficient foot support.Good quality.I wear size 12 and these shoes fit me perfectly at that size. They are very attractive and look like high end sneakers or boat shoes. When my friends discovered the zipper openings on the side, they were gobsmacked. My arthritic hands deeply appreciate those zippers. These easily have become my favorite shoes.I can get my shoe on over my kafo by myself with these!\\n\\nNow how about a penny loafer style and a deck shoe in 14 super wideBillys makes shoes that fit ocer her AFO and provide needed support. Billys also allows us to buy one pair of shoes with 2 different sizes and widths! Way to go Billys! Thank you for helping us take care of our stroke survivor.Ideal for children/adults with disabilities. Hopefully the zipper will last as long as the last pair (18 months). Pretty good for folks who wear SMOs in their shoes!I am a stroke survivor who wears an  AFO which other shoes can\\'t accommodate. These shoes can and have therefore transformed my life They are amazing!These shoes are awesome. I am on my feet all day on a cement floor and after the day they feel glorious. I’m going to buy these again.I ordered the original rapidweld and the exo. The exo for me are far superior. They have a wider toe box and are not as narrow at the rapidweld and the added structure for support. I want more colors already! I ordered a half size up from my normal Van\\'s size.I loved the look of these shoes, but didn\\'t like the material.  Felt more like plastic than leather, and the \"checks\" showed through the top panel.  Probably only the wearer would see it, but it annoyed it.  The fit was great, though.  But I gotta be in love to keep $85 shoes, and will be returning.My son loves the comfort of this shoe. Unfortunately we had to return 2 pairs of them because there was a defect in the side stripe causing it to detach from the shoe.  We didn\\'t notice right away with the first pair, but second pair was like it right out of the box.  It was such a bummer!I love these shoes! But I know that vans and converse don’t really have any support so I have to wear inserts and I always buy a little larger to accommodate the insert . The shoe inserts/insoles that come with the shoe Are removable. I have bad feet so me saying that the shoes don’t have a lot of support might not be accurate for somebody else who doesn’t have foot issues. I do really love these shoes and want more colors.I bought a pair of these about 3 months ago, and they are now totally worn out.  I wore them outside to walk my dog a couple of times a day, for a total of about 2.5 miles a day.\\n\\nThey soles started wearing very quickly, and at about 3 months, the inserts completely separated, and then the backing along the \"slip in\" separated from the piece of plastic that provides the key feature of this shoe (\"slip in\").\\n\\nIt is now pretty much unusable since I have to bend over and put it on with my finger to avoid the fabric from folding over against my heel.\\n\\nAlso, this is my 2nd pair of Skechers, and the first pair did not last very long either, but I attributed that to the fact I wore them every day during a major remodel project of our house.\\n\\nApparently these shoes are more for light and casual wear, not for every day use.\\n\\nI am now trying a pair of Kiziks as they were one of the pioneers of the slip-in style of shoe, and I will report back on how they compare to the Skecher slip in.\\n\\nAvoid would be my bottom line.I bought a pear of it, and the foam started coming out after a couple uses, it soon start hurting my feet and I stopped using it.As a disabled veteran with a bad back and bad hips, putting on shoes and socks has literally been a pain. These shoes eliminate the pain of bending over to put my shoes on.My husband had a stroke this easy to put onHusband loves them!This pair of shoes from Cole-Hahn takes the prize for the most uncomfortable shoes I\\'ve ever tried to wear.I love my other Cole Haan shoes, but these were an expensive disappointment. Had to exchange for a smaller size which feels okay but not great. Lovely to look at, though.Size perfectI needed to go down about a size and a half from my normal athletic shoe size to get the best fit. At first it seemed like a tight and stiff fit but i knew they would stretch after wearing. After wearing them around the house for a day they now fit perfect. I like the look and feel as a casual shoe.I absolutely love these sneakers. I have a shoe addiction and due to a pinched nerve, I must be careful as to what I purchase as certain styles cause me a lot of discomfort. However, these are like walking on clouds and I absolutely love them.\\n\\nA must have in my opinion.I have been buying Rockports for many, many years. I love them primarily for three reasons. The first reason is that I never have to break them in - I just put them on brand new and go to work and I don\\'t have any \"breaking in new shoes\" discomfort. Second reason is that they last for 1-2 years as work shoes (I do alternate work shoes) and I am on my feet all day. I can then use them for home shoes for another year. The third reason is that they are consistent - I buy the same size and type of Rockport and they always fit the same way.After giving these shoes a try, I find the other reviews a little hard to believe. They certainly look nice, but I found the Rockports extremely uncomfortable. They have very little padding in the soles, and they rubbed against my heels on the outside. They did not seem so bad until I wore them to a party. Standing around for extended periods of time really started to hurt the heels and balls of my feet. It became extremely uncomfortable. I would expect this from dress shoes. But according to reviews, and a recommendation from a Zappos representative, I was led to believe that these would be very comfortable as daily wear shoes. I switched to a pair of Asics that I have had in the closet, and the difference was night and day. They have super soft and comfortable cushioning! Oh, and the laces are too short.Rockport have moved manufacturing of their men\\'s World Tour Classic to India from Vietnam, and everything changed in the quality and feel of the shoes. Now, they are stiffer, not comfortable and have a rigid feel. Made my feet ache after wearing them for an hour. Also there are manufacturing defects, like metal burrs inside eyelets that shred laces.\\nIt\\'s the same model number - K71185 - as those wonderful and comfortable shoes made in Vietnam but it ends there. I strongly recommend against buying them.Extremely comfortable! Walk on concrete floors all day, have a bad knee and with these shoes my knee and feet do not hurt or bother me by the time I get home...actually forget I have them on! True to size. Going to order another pair in a different color.My first pair of Rockports. Very nice shoes, comfortable and my full-length custom orthotics fit very nicely in them. I appreciate that I could order it in a Narrow width.Material felt like plastic, not leather.....very cheap leatherFit was great, leather was nice for the cost and the style was just what I was looking for. Actually bought a black pair first, and before I ever wore them out I ordered the brown pair. Great shoe.Beautiful shoe. One of those which can be worn both as formal and casual.Very nice quality, looks sharp and my husband said very comfortable right out of the box.Feet not the same so I added a thin extra insole to right and stretched the left overnight.   Very comfortable -  Perfect fit.Love the slip-ins, and the shoes were very comfortable. However, the toe ripped out the second time he wore them.  I have reached out to Skechers and they have requested photos and details; however, I have now not heard back from them. I wear a lot of Skechers, and have never had this happen before, so I am hopeful that Skechers will stand behind their product and make it right.This is my first pair of sketchers. \\n Size and fit are spot on. My foot slides in very easy and my heel doesn\\'t feel like it\\'s slipping out. The only possible negative would be, if you want to change insoles, it\\'s not possible on these. They are glued in. But, that\\'s irrelevant to me as they are very comfortable and I\\'m extremely happy with them.These shoes fit perfectly out of the box. Comfort from the beginning.They don\\'t fit the same as my current SkechersLove the way they feel on your feet. Comfortable yet give great support to your feet. Cool and breathable on your feet. Is stylish enough to be casual or for dressing up.I purchased these shoes last month to have nice looking comfortable shoes for vacation. I have several pairs of Cole Haan including dress, casual, chukkas, boots, tennis, and boat shoes. These are the only pair I don\\'t care for. I like the looks and they feel pretty good on the feet, but they are very squeaky - embarrassingly so. The squeak comes from the heel of both shoes and seems to be associated with the decorative darker leather finishing just above the sole at the heel.  I thought it would go away after a few hours or days, but 6 weeks later it\\'s still just as loud.  Maybe I got a defective pair, but for now I\\'m stuck with expensive lawn mowing shoes.  At least I can\\'t hear them over the mower...These are the best looking sneakers I\\'ve ever seen - look better in person. Quality of product and style are fantastic. Regrettably, I had to return them. I wear wide with shoes, and was happy to see this option available. However, when they arrived and I opened the box, I had to check the label to make sure they were wide (did not look so). The label was correct, but the width was not wide by any measure. My foot felt like it was being crushed on all sides. I considered there might be a break in period, but seriously doubt the severity of the constriction would alleviate to ever make the shoes comfortable.  If you have a narrow foot, these are probably great.I have purchased hundreds of pairs of sneakers and these Cole Haans are by far the most comfortable. I know a good thing when I see it… I bought four more pairs!The best shoes I had in a long time. They are with better look , quality and support than Nike Air Force 1. The twins in those shoes. Plus Nike doesn’t offer wide sizes. I already got many compliments about them. I like them so much i bought 3 pairs/ different colors.  If you like sporty looking and super comfortable shoes this is perfect for you. The leather is top notch quality. Some people are complaining from squeaking noise. No worries. After you get the shoes just put all over specially in the back where is a little flap /under the flap leather conditioner. Your shoes will thank you. The leather will be softer and last longer and squeaky noise will disappear.Amazing shoes. Cole Haan fails a fair bit, but with THIS design they have really done well. I own not only the Blue Wing Red version, but several others as well.I have wide feet and collapsed arches.  Hard to find comfortable shoes that fit.  I usually wear a 10 2E in New Balance, 10.5 Wide in Vans.  I actually bought my first pair in store in a size 10 - Medium Width, and was surprised to find that they fit.  Bought my second pair online in Wide, and couldn’t tell much of a difference, which is fine, because they fit perfect.  I’ve tried other shoes from Cole Haan, and the Traveler sneakers are just generally roomier and more comfortable.Perfect fit in the wide selection, unlike 2 other similar Cole Haan styles that I tried in the same size.very comfortable and they look great...Felt narrow and just wasn\\'t comfortabletoe box too narrowDefinitely a very good looking shoe! It is a harder insole- not a lot of cushion, would not want to walk a long distance in them, but they are not uncomfortable either.These sneaks are actually quite comfortable. There is little to no real arch support, so if you need that support you’ll need to add it yourself. They’re a bit wider than Stan Smiths, which is good for me. The leather is soft right out of the box and the sole of the shoe is unusually soft and flexible (in a good way). The style is on point, and they look good with everything. As for fit, the 44 seems larger than most 44s — I wear a 10.5–11 in most sneaks and 10-10.5 in most shoes and the 43 was perfect.horrible fit, very narrow in the frontProbably the most uncomfortable shoe I have ever put on.Excellent sneakers, they are ready to wear out of the box and comfortable. I usually fit in a 40 EU but I had to get a 41 because they run a bit small.I\\'ve been very pleased with these sneakers. I have several brands of this style of retro sneaker and these Keds are among the most comfortable. They\\'re well made and look great. I would purchase them again3Months after Purchasing these Pro Keds, The Rubber that encircles the sole started peeling off!! The quality is not good!! \\n\\nI was very diappionted with the quality of the Product compared to what they used to be back in the 70\\'s.\\n\\nI personally wouldn\\'t recommend them to anyone who is looking for a descent quality/nostalgia in Old School SneakersI normally wear Vans slip-on men’s 8.5(women’s 10). So I decided to try the 8.5 and it fit perfectly. The insole can be removed to accommodate another type of insole. This style Pro Keds were the first pair of sneakers I wore 45 years ago.I was pleasantly surprised by these shoes. They felt a little large, and a little hard in the insoles initially, but they proved themselves both supportive and comfortable after a little break-in period. They\\'ve served me well for the past year, and they garnered a lot of compliments too!i love the pro keds and thank you for my $25.00 discount\\n\\nthe most importan for me is the free shippingits an uncomfortable relatavely ugly shoe. definitely not worth the price.Love these shoes \\n\\nGreat style, great fitSize is fine. The materials of the upper are a little stiff but not uncomfortably so. The style and color way are the best part. The laces can be tucked discreetly on each side and remain in the shoe and not flopping around. Overall not as comfortable as the On Roger Advantage but they’re more stylish.Very clunky and heavy.  Weighed almost twice as much as my other On running shoes.  Was really excited to get them, but they were very disappointing.  Very cool color combo though.Fit exactly like the rest of the Roger line.The shoe was fine but after trying it on in person I wasn\\'t real crazy about the appearance (nor was the wife).  Hence the return.  I think it was the material used in the body that is the issue.The fit of the size 11 was OK.  The 10.5 was small. I usually wear a 10.5\\nI was not so crazy about the style of the shoes. Primarily the material of the body of the shoe.The size and fit are great. I really like these shoes. Unfortunately, the sole started separating from the leather after less than a month of wear. I was very disappointed because I liked them so much.I wear a 9.5 D in men’s moloa, bought these in 10’s. Comfortable and on mark for style! Im 50 and my teenage daughter recommends! Says age appropriate and look good!!Overall perfect for any activity. With no socks there’s a small stitch on the back that’s annoying but other than that A+I liked them, very comfortable, already a few compliments. They feel a little wider than normal, but that is actually more comfortable, especially after a long day. Like the flipdown to wear as slidesShoes fit and feel great. Have worn with jeans and shorts and matches well with both. Easy to clean as well.Just as good as the platform style. Sizing is the same. Comfortable with no added weight. Pics shows difference between platform and stackform. Unisex style for men and women. Need more colors.These are so fun and versatile, very comfortable too.Already own a \"stacked\" version but decided on a stackform style, and I must say- I love these waaayyyy more!!! the platform isnt heavy, unlike the stacked, these dont have the additional grip at the bottom, which actually allows for the bottom sole of the shoe to be fully flushed with the floor. These are not heavy at all, I walk DTLA with no complaints! The textured pattern is really nice and evaluates the shoe to be a bit less casual for a sneaker. I am a size 9 in all my vans, and these fit perfect .I\\'ve had these shoes for less than a year, and after about only 6 months or less, the sole started separating from the rest of the shoes on each side. This is the second pair of stackforms that I\\'ve owned, and they both have done this.These shoes are super cute and have a great platform profile, while still being very stable for everyday wear.Great style and quality. I made the mistake of ordering true to size. I actually skate in these, which breaks them in faster and loosens them up. If you’re skating these shoes, probably order a size in a half down.The fit on these loafers are incredible, super comfortable, and sleek as can be!! Definitely recommend.Suede on these puppies are glorious. I Really love the fit, shape,and structure of this loafer.These shoes are amazing. I am an engineering professional who is on my feet about 6 to 7 hours a day at work, which is mostly concrete and marble flooring. I also suffer from planter fasciitis, which means my feet are hardly ever happy. These shoes have changed the way my feet feel at work and in the evening. Literally all I did was change my shoes and my feet remarkably better, and I am astounded. I rarely provide reviews but thought I should share a little of my story in case it could help you. I bought the same size as my gym shoes, and they fit perfectly.These are great looking and very comfortable shoes.\\n\\nUnfortunately, like other Cole Han’s I’ve had in the past, the bottom of these shoes is made of an easily tarnished material. Hit your toe against the curb once? Ruined. The material doesn’t just get scuffed, it rips and tears in small ways, and is quickly past the point of no return.Nice product. Color I had been searching for and available in a wide size. Seems to be truer fit than a previous almost identical shoe in a different color. Good choice is you want something different in a casual Summer shoe.I love these causal shoes for their lightness, comfort and design. Drawbacks are the misleading colors from the photos depicted. They\\'re not as varied as the photographic lighting shows. They\\'re actually plain once you receive them. And the other drawback is the discomfort from the outer edge of the foot insert while driving. If you tend to roll your left foot slightly while driving you may experience a hard line edging into your ankles skin.goodUnisex sizing doesn\\'t work on this product. Women\\'s feet are not as bulky and thick as men\\'s feet and this model is designed for men.  Bring back 990V5.I recently bought 2 pairs of NB 990v6 shoes from Zappos. I\\'ve been buying shoes this way for 20 years. These will be the last 990s I\\'ll buy. Where did the supportive cushioning go? Where the anti-roll feature?  To me it\\'s worth the extra cost to support our US industry and US workers, but I won\\'t buy these anymore. Could someone please recommend to me a GOOD substitute for NB walking shoes? A VIP Zappos shopper.I\\'ve been wearing earlier versions of this sneaker for years because they fit well and look nice, and stand up to high mileage. So far the transition to this new pair has been seamless. Same great look and fit!This rating is for the 990 V6 in Triple Black.  Huge disappointment.   I’ve been buying 990’s since the 1990’s and this is my third pair of 990 V6’s.  Unfortunately, they do not don’t fit like previous pairs (much larger in shoes marked the same size) and not nearly as comfortable as previous pairs.  They do not have close to as much cushioning which is something I really need due to injury.\\n\\nI was very excited to have the all black option.  It never occurred to me that they would not be comparable to a pair of 990 V6’s that I bought last year.  In the past New Balance could be counted on for consistency. Not any more, I guess.arrived quickly and just as expected.I ordered these shoes yesterday, and received them today. Unbelievable job Zappos! I wasn\\'t sure what size to order so I asked for some online help. I must have received the right answer because when I tried them on, they fit great. They are totally cute and I love them! I actually bought two pairs. The Classic in Bright Rose and Cortina in Camel (the inside is lined in faux sheepskin). I love them both! Thanks Zappos!I wanted to find some nice sneakers that would be equally suitable to wear both with jeans and skirts, and I am happy with my purchase of Superga Torino!Beautiful shoe. Really cool! No support. No cushioning.Runs really big. I ordered my usual size and they were almost an inch too long. Otherwise the fit was good in the width. They do not run narrow. I love the color and the soft feel of the canvas. I can\\\\\\'t wait to get the right size.Superga - \\nThese sneakers are super comfortable and cool!! I got so many compliments from people all over the city. I will definitely get another pair in a different color. Thanks ZapposGood looking, well made shoe.  Easy on/off.Excellent quality, very comfortable!New driving shoes Fosho  for the weekendGreat fit. Very comfortable. Some have posted that it\\'s more like a slipper. Yes it\\'s soft and feels like a slipper on the foot, but I wear them everywhere. Nice informal shoe and comfortable.The shoes are very stylish and look great!\\nI have received several compliments.Love them! Sized up and they turned out to be a perfect fit for my wide feets.I\\'m a senior citizen and beginner weight lifter. I need balance deadlifting.  I read about Vans on power lifting websites.  I bought some for the gym.  First I removed the glued down insoles, not too hard to do.  Put in my prescription, custom orthotics.  These Vans have flat bottoms and they stick to the floor.  Perfectly level and stable.  So glad Vans makes a wide shoe.  I tested these out during deadlifts and I am very satisfied with them. For my purposes these shoes are outstanding.  They have 9 eyelets and wide cotton laces so I can tighten them exactly the way I want.  This is my first pair of Vans. \\nPOSITIVES:\\nExcellent weight lifting shoes especially dead lifts and leg presses.\\nThey grip the floor.\\nThey look good.\\n9 pair of eyelets.\\nReasonably priced.Great shoe - very happy to find this Vans Old Skool shoe in wide width!  I normally wear a 10.5, but found this shoe fits me much better at 11.My son had a pair of these in a size 13 regular, but he complained that they hurt his feet, so he never wore them. He really liked them though so I decided to try again. He has wide feet so I was thinking 14 wide, but they didn\\'t have wide, so I ordered a regular 14 and they were too long and too narrow. So I decided to go back down and try a 13 wide and they were too tight. They didn\\'t look wide at all and when we measured them against his 13 regular pair, they were almost identical. The heel of the 13 wide was about 1mm wider than the regular, but the rest of the shoe was the same, so I\\'m not sure how they classify these as a wide width.I\\'ve been waiting for the day WIDES skated out ! Oh man do they feel good !  highly recommend these!Beautiful shoes but they run wider than marked. I am returning the wide and exchange them for regular.Couldnt remove insoles to use my essential orthoticsThese are very comfortable, look good, and in an easy neutral color.at home just when I want to relax after a long day all I want is my Skechers Respected Holmgren LoL, so comfy, the quality, the feel, everything its just top notch. Skechers its now COOL!!!My husband is very pleased with these shoes. He is a long-time Merrell shoe wearer and believes these are more comfortable than the mocs. He said the wide shoe is nice because his foot isn’t squeezing into the shoe with his heavy socks. The length of the shoe is true to size. The hands free feature is helpful for a fast slip-on shoe. Overall, great shoe! We found it interesting that the rubber on the shoe is made by Goodyear. Hopefully then he gets many miles out of these shoes!Maybe these are good shoes if you don’t wear them that often, but they definitely won’t stand up to everyday use. The finish on the leather is so thin it wore off areas in less than two months of COVID lockdown use. That’s not much walking. The leather is starting to split in places - they’re comfortable and looked great new but wow, such incredibly low quality.How can I convey my personal experience? I wore my white Florsheim sneakers to the car dealership, and they practically gave me what I wanted. Then I went to the airport, and they said there was no need to remove my shoes, because they were too awesome. Then I was walking across the stage to receive my award, and they only wanted to take pictures of my shoes. They\\'re that good.Great casual shoe with jeans or shorts. Lightest leather shoe I have ever owned. Very comfortable, and great to walk in. True to size and felt great right out of the box.A really nice casual shoe that I have worn to the office and on weekends around the house.   Very comfortable.   I take a wide size and only wish more of the colors were available in wide.I\\'m a woman from the Philippines suffering from diabetic neuropathy and I  bought this pair because it looked comfortable.   This would be my first pair from Florsheim and I am so glad I bought  this. ?\\n\\nI jazzed this pair with a gold fringe from a local seller.Bought these for my 92 year old Dad who is still very stylish. He loves that he doesn\\'t have to bend over to put them on, they live up to there name!Since shoulder surgery these have been great. Now if i can get my underwire on!Every day use, comfortable, easy on and off, durable and washable is a plusHubby was a doubter, until he wore them. I bought them for him to wear post op hip replacement surgery. Perfect! Easy on, easy off, comfortable.I am a woman who wears a 9.5 or sometimes 10 shoe, but I really don\\'t like that ALL women\\'s shoes have pink, purple or turquoise on them.  So hard to find plain gray or black shoes, so I decided to try men\\'s shoes!  I read that the conversion is 1.5 sizes smaller, but I found with these Skechers that 2-2.5 sizes is better.  And I love them!  They\\'re not too wide and I don\\'t look like I\\'m wearing men\\'s shoes--they are proportional.  The only downside is that the fabric on the black version has quite a bit of navy, or a very blue-ish black in the marled pattern, which stands out against the true black trim of the laces.This is my favorite style and f Vans and at this price, I got these to wear to work every day.Love these old skool vans.  I have them in most colors.  They are comfy for a bit, but if walking many miles in a day, consider purchasing a vans shoe that has added cushion.   I have a couple pair with the added cushion and they are very comfy.Fits good but the \"white\" checkered is actually like a cream color not a real white. Super bummed.Had a very difficult time getting my heel into these, even with a big show horn. The heel is too stiff and rigid. Once in, the fit was fine — except ZERO arch support. Now I remember why I stopped buying Vans decades ago.Bought for my wife to wear to work (chiropractic) lasted 2 months and the bottoms stared to separate from the cloth JUNK JUNK JUNK JUNK JUNK JUNK JUNKVery comfortableI like the material. Suede and leather. The toe looks cool too!Typical Adidas fit for men--I wear a 13 but the Adidas 14 fits perfectly.Look good but little support.Bought them for my 15-year-old son, they\\'re just a touch bigger than expected (compared to similar Adidas he owns), but he\\'s still growing, so that will be just fine.The fit and size are fine, it is the quality that is off.  I have worn the classic, traditional black converse for years and this tan pair does not compare.  Converse is skimping on quality and construction.  The shoe was lighter, less sturdy, skimpier overall as if it was a knockoff and the shoelace holes were misaligned so it looks askew on the right shoe.    This is a Converse problem, not a Zappos issue.  The price is not cheap for such poor quality.   Zappos gave me great customer service in making it right but Converse should be ashamed of themselves.AnazingThe usual converse fit but a little loose without socks.I order on half size larger so I can add a high arch support.  Works perfectly.My husband loves them! Now he want them in all colors!These shoes are really nice quality and the only reason I am returning them is they are too narrow in the toebox. I hope Sperry will realize there are a lot of potential customers out there with wide feet!Just got these and less than a month the right sole is starting to  separate at three different spotsI usually wear an 8, however, this particular pair was about a half size too big.  this is my 4th pair and i love them.  they\\'re great on the deck of my sailboat and stylish when off the boat.Sperry brand runs narrow in general. I ordered my normal 7 wide, but did an easy exchange up a half size (7.5 wide) to get the right fit. Process was easy and this is a great shoe!Good fit and nice look with shortsIt is about time that a shoe is stylish and comfortable for someone who has an AFO and is a stroke survivor! Thank you for making my husband like he\\'s still hip!My husband has mobility issues, these shoes make it very easy to put shoes on and take them off!My son has dyspraxia so it can be a struggle to find shoes that he can put on easily but that still look \"cool\" and normal.  He really liked these shoes, so much so that we are buying them again, just in a bigger size since he has grown.My husband loves these shoes that are so comfortable and easy to put on and take off with the integral zipper.  This is his 2nd pair of Billy shoes and probably he will be buying more!Not as wide as I had expected. The zipper accessory didn\\'t really help in my case.  I can see it being useful to an aid putting the shoes on, but it was actually MORE cumbersome than laces alone.Fits true to size and easy to slip on and they look great.The shoe was too long and not wide enough.  Otherwise a really nice shoe that is exceptionally well-made, but not the fit I was hoping to find.These were listed as men\\'s 9.5/womens 11.5.  However, I received a women\\'s 9.5I spent 17 years in the Army and have had every name brand of running shoe ever made. I thought I\\'ve had several \"great\" pairs that were supportive and/or helped my stride, joint fatigue, etc. But after going for my first short run in my HOKA\\'s I am convinced that I will never own another brand for that purpose. I\\'ve been telling everyone I know, so now I am telling you, good people of the internet the same thing. Spend the money, they are worth every penny. I am hopeful that they will come out with some more stylish options soon, but these were the best looking ones for me.Great shoes, they fit and feel great on my feet. I got the shoes on July 21, 2024. The adhesive holding the fabric around the shoelaces is starting to come undone. Hoka if you\\'re going to charge me a premium for shows I expect better quality.Saying good by all schetchers and nike!!Bought these shoes for the gym. Tired them on and immediately noticed it was extremely uncomfortable on the inside arch of my feet .\\nI have never worn wide shoes, but these seemed way to narrow in the standard width.Used for one week for normal walking and to the gym. Lightly worn with rotating between old Nike shoes and this. Within a week I noticed the rubber on the sole falling off. This indicates horrible quality and for its premium price, totally not worth it. Comfortability is mediocre and customer service was terrible. Company provided label for return service but its going to take 5-10 days by USPS. Customer service (Natalie) lacks problem solving and empathy for these type of issues. Horrible product quality, wouldnt recommend purchasing considering you may have to go through the hassle of returning.As someone with a wide foot it is hard to find shoes.  I usually have to go up a half a size to compensate.  This shoe in the wide fit, fit perfectly, and I didn’t have to go up a half a size.  So happy with my purchase. Love the style as well!Is like slipping into a sock on a cloud. I have wide flat feet and these are great!They were too narrow. I chose a wide width and 1/2 size up, but they didn\\'t have enough width in the forefoot. Also, the footbed felt oddly uncomfortable no matter what insoles I tried in them. I\\'ve been wearing wide NB running shoes for over a decade, so these were definitely a departure from their normal comfort.\\nIt\\'s too bad, as they were really great looking. Hopefully NB will re-issue a similar looking shoe but with a fit that\\'s more consistent to their others.These seem to make me roll forward to the ball of my foot and there isn\\'t much support there. They aren\\'t the best for tailor bunion pre and post surgery.NB - er for life. Very comfortable shoes - good support and lightweight.  Definitely try another model though for better lateral stability (and design)I bought my pair of Vans SK8 Hi\\'s last week and they\\'ve arrived today, as expected, in pitch perfect shape. At first, I was wide eyed with excitement at the sight of my new shoes. However, there were a couple of chores that I came across which didn\\'t diminish my enjoyment of them as much as postponed it. First is the lacing. Don\\'t try to bar lace these particular high tops. Instead, do the criss-cross way as demonstrated on the pictures right here on Zappos. Second, don\\'t tie it all the way to the last hole. Why? Because it will be a pain if not impossible to put them on. This is a very tight shoe. Not uncomfortable, but tight around your foot. In my case, I had to leave the top two rows alone to achieve the perfect balance between the practicality of putting them on and the length of the laces when I tied them up. And now finally we come to the shoe itself. Vans has always been setting standards of skate shoes, but the Sk8 Hi is a shoe that can be worn seemingly anywhere. The closest I can get to comparing it with another shoe would be the Chuck All Stars, however this shoe feels much sturdier and durable. I also advise to wear it with regular socks, not short ones simply because if you start getting sweaty it will get sticky down there because of the leather. As far as style goes, to each his own, but I always appreciated the old school look of Vans. They bring up memories of shoes I\\'ve worn in the past and yet make it contemporary enough to turn some heads. It is the fusion of the old and the new, the pioneers and the rookies, and it works all too well. I wear Chuck\\'s in 9 so I bought these in 9.5 and they fit perfectly. I strongly recommend these to anyone who appreciates practicality over complexity.Zappos sent me a completely WORN ITEM in the wrong size with absolutely no remorse!!!!! Will never spend another dollar here! These photos are exactly how they arrived !I\\'m a longtime Converse wearer but decided to switch to Vans because they seemed a bit sturdier. They did feel less flimsy than chucks and I really liked the style- I got black on black and they went with everything, were comfortable and didn\\'t require any break-in time. However, less than 6 months of not particularly strenuous wear (I wore them about 6 days a week as just a regular walking around shoe- I don\\'t skate, and I wore other shoes for working out and hiking) they have a hole in the toe and a hole in the insole. I was really happy with these when I got them but am hesitant to buy another pair if they\\'re going to wear out this quickly.I love these shoes, I have narrow feet and it\\'s hard to find shoes that fit right. I mountain bike, hike, and climb trees amongst other outdoor activities. These shoes work great for me all around. The only thing I do to improve these is put in an insole, because they lack a little padding for my taste.Fantastic Shoes - \\nHow can I not rate these at 5 stars? Yes they take a little to break in but then they are awsome shoes!!! I wear a size 9 shoe normally but I know with these shoes I need to get an 8 and a half size. For VISION shoes it goes the other way. Vans has been consistant on this so far. Knowing this fact made it easy to order online with no fear of returns. I LOVE the shoes. Also had SUPER FAST delivery!!!the fit is great...first shoe I can actually just pull up and on...I opened the box and the box was full of tiny black hair.\\nThe shoes had hair inside of them - like someone wore them without socks and walked around in the shoes.\\nI immediately closed the box and promptly returned the shoes.\\n\\nI expect more from a brand like Zappos. Absolutely disgusting experienceGood stuff. Would buy again.perfectThese are super lightweight and very comfortable. I’m on my feet all day so I need comfort and support. These seem to provide both. More arch support than the fresh foam thick running sole shoes but nothing stiff. I like the look of them as well, pretty versatile style. Very pleased with them so far. (About 2 weeks)I really liked all aspects of the shoe but the open foam on the tongue makes the shoe feel and appear very cheap.Have to agree with the other review here, the unfinished tongue with the foam really is terrible. I had concerns about durability there, but I wasn\\'t ready for how bad it would actually *look*. The foam peaking out looks bad, and the whole tongue is very yellow and clashes with the rest of the white shoe. Absolutely loved the show otherwise, was very sad to return.Shoes fit great, I like the style overall. However the tongue of the shoe feels incredibly cheap compared to the rest of it. The edge of the tongue leaves raw yellow foam exposed. It feels really weird to have this kind of material be presented as intentional when it feels like a mistake. The foam material does not feel sturdy and would easily fray. I wish the tongue was finished rather than left intentionally open like this. The pictures do not show this element very well either. I’m considering sending these back, even though I like everything else about the shoe because I’m concerned about the overall longevity of the shoe due to the exposed foam.My favorite sneaker right now! So comfortable, looks great with everything.Fits true to size. I can swap out the insoles for my custom orthotics and they still fit great. Great cushion.I am a long time Birkenstock wearer, still have my first pair of Bostons that I purchased 30+years ago. I had been looking for a pair of white sneakers that were comfy and good for walking, the Bends were perfect.  Fast forward 6 months, I wore the shoes 2-3 times a week for short neighborhood dog walks and quick errands (covid times).  I couldn\\'t understand why my feet were getting wet (foggy mornings) and there always seemed to be a thin layer of dirt in the shoes.  After some investigating I discovered that the soles were splitting along the lines of the pressed in pattern and slowly disintegrating.  These shoes can not be resoled.  I guess I expected much better quality from Birkenstock especially for the price.I\\'m in longtime recovery from Plantar Fasciitis.  As soon as I put these on, my feet said, \"yes, yes, yes!\" Good arch support, excellent toe freedom. These are less cushioned than my go-to Hoka One Ones, but I feel they are good for transitioning post PF, so that I can build up my own arches. And plenty of room for orthotics, although I\\'m going to use their footbed for the time being.  Note the footbed is not their original super-rigid footbed (which I prefer),  but is made of actual cork and has significant arch support. Time will tell.  I\\'m 8 1/2 (9 in some shoes) and 39 N was perfect for me.Everything about this shoe is just what I wanted it to be (except the color--but I can live with that). The tops of my feet are sensitive, and lace-up shoes generally cause me pain; but these, for whatever reason, don\\'t have that problem. And for shoes that have a long series of lacings, they are amazingly quick and easy to get into and out of. The support is just what I have come to expect from Birkenstock, but they are also very flexible, making it easy to break them in and pleasurable to walk. And because they are unisex, the width is wide enough for me, even with bunions. I love them.I live in Birkenstock Arizona sandals all summer, so I was psyched to see these sneakers released. I initially ordered one size larger than my normal, because I was worried they\\'d be too short (just based on how much room I have between the ends of my toes and the ends of the sandals), but I ended up exchanging them for the same size I wear in the sandals, and they fit perfectly. These are not sneakers I would shoot hoops in or work out in, but they\\'re basically perfect for the same things you would do in a sandal (walking around, hanging out), just in the form of a sneaker. Perfect for year-round wear.I definitely would not call this style NARROW as I ordered, for it is definitely a Medium width.  He Birkenstock, Regular/wide would be so very wide. \\nI wear the regular/wide in their ladies Arizkna sandals. Leather and construction is amazing!  The white is gorgeous and can wear with everything.my toes have wiggle room and no cramping or rubbing anywhere.  Due to being a shoe designed for both male and female sizing, unisex, the narrow/medium width fits my women\\'s b/c width.  I wear a 9 or 9.5 in most shoes and the 40 narrow/ medium is perfect in this model.  Love Birkenstock!!!Please stick with separate men\\'s and women\\'s sizing and half sizesSix weeks after foot surgery, when allowed to get out of the orthopedic boot, I went looking for comfortable shoes with support that could accomodate my still swollen foot. I told the salesperson I wear Hoka Recovery Slides around the house, and she introduced me to the brand new Restore TCs. They were the perfect solution! I could not have found a better shoe for my transition back to foot health. Thank you Hoka!I use my other Hokas (4 pair total) for workouts but bought these after surgery that keeps me from bending over for six weeks. These slip ons are perfect for letting me continue lots of walking without having to fiddle with bending down to tie shoe laces. Much more than flimsy house shoes, which aren\\'t stable for my feet, these shoes allow me to get in my steps each day even if I\\'m not doing a \"real\" workout.I bought these to use around the house while recovering from a leg injury.  These are perfect!  I can slip them on without using any assistance.  They have a largetoe box for people like me who have wide feet in that area.  I also have a high arch and these still slip on.  No rubbing or discomfort.  They do make a funny noise if you don\\'t wear socks so I am.  Hoping for more colors.  Will likely buy a second pair.Very very  comfortable shoes.I love it!I wear 8.5 but since they don\\'t have it, I get the size 9.Size was fine, however,  width much to narrow, unable to wear. have an older pair made in china, and setting side by side can see a very noticeable difference in width.I\\'ve been wearing these shoes for years.  I\\'ve noticed this recent pair seems to be made cheaper than the last.  I can feel it when they\\'re on, so I don\\'t agree with the other posts of the great continued quality.  I\\'ve compared them to my previous ones and you can also see and feel it in the material and weight.  I question if they are real leather or imitation and if the soles are of the same composite.  They\\'re still good shoes though.  It seems the quality went down and the price went up.  Reebok seems to be cheapening this shoe to see how far they can go until we don\\'t buy them anymore.  The usual business practice.So, all through my childhood I remember my Grandpa would wear the hell outta these. He was the man I always looked up to. Unfortunately he passed a long time ago. But when I still look at these shoes, all I think of is him and the kind of dude he was. Great memories I have of him. And these shoes are tied to him. So with that being said, the shoes are great. The leather is of great quality, which you dont see every day. It creases easily, which is what you get with good leather believe it or not. But it doesnt matter to me, they age nicely. And will last a long time. Hopefully they keep up this kind of quality.I\\'ve been wearing Reeboks for nearly 30 years and this style for nearly 20, and the quality I was accustomed to has deteriorated as badly as this pair of shoes. I started getting separation between the upper toe and the welt within a few months. As a result, moisture is admitted, dirt cakes in the resulting gap, and the white finish has started peeling away. As much as I like this style, I will not be purchasing any more Reebok lifestyle shoes since this seems to be indicative of the quality no longer built into them.It says Width: D - Medium  way to narrow and had my measurements taken by shoe store.  This is the second pair I had to return as I ordered them a day apart. I seenRuns extremely narrow, does not break in.  I even purchased shoe stretchers. To try and loosen them up.  I religiously wear hookers for running, really wish the shoe was wide enough for my feet. It\\'s a great shoe.The Hoka Transport needs to be revised to have a wider toe box.  Since it has a cordura upper (which is a stiff material), it needs to be widened to accommodate wide footed customers.  Other than that, everything is good to go.Love how easy the shoe is to put on and take off, perfect for airport travel.  Bought these new and went strait into a 3 week European trip with a good amount of walking/hiking and they help up great!Bought these for a trip to Mexico City. Wore them everyday walking from 10-13 miles/day. Comfortable with great support.Hoka understands the foot better than all other manufacturers. I say this after 50 years in the athletic footwear industry.I was excited about the color after returning the gray ones because they were too big and the tip of the toe was shaped weird. This green pair was really nice but not comfortable at all. No foot support so I will be returning them.Fit and size is good for what I am used to, as I had the same size in another pair of Adidas shoes previously.  Arch support is fairly low, but still comfortable if you aren\\'t standing too long.  Materials seem really nice, and the shoes feels nice on my feet, but I could see them getting hot after wearing for a while.  My only real gripes are that the gum sole looks like a lighter color in person as opposed to on the internet.  Also, the sole is pretty thick and chunky looking in person.  Overall, they are close enough to what I expected for the money, and I like the colors and materials used.PerfectConfused. I ordered a Men\\'s 7 by mistake it turns out. I don\\'t know how that happened, but they are quite chunky looking, but felt comfy. I am going to try to order the correct size for me 7.5 Women\\'s. They do seem wide enough in the \\'medium\\' width, but that was men\\'s so maybe I\\'ll have to order up a half size again, if the 7.5 women\\'s is too narrow.  I just wish all brands would offer \\'men\\'s colors\\' for women.A women’s size 7 fits like an 8.5 or 9. Ridiculous having to guess at which size I could order that would actually fit my size 7 foot. Returned.Great shoe, great customer service!!Even if you go a half size up as most recommend, it\\'s still a bit too snug, especially in the toe box. \\nOtherwise, construction is sound, plenty of cushion, but these are built for a narrow fit.Very well fitted shoe but go 1/2 size up. I also have the 3x and 5’s and these seem to be more of a cross country fit. The new support helps roll your foot a bit better as well. Just wish they had more color options.Very comfortable and cute!I’m a woman and usually wear 8.5 in US women’s.  I got these in men’s 7.5 and 8, which is equivalent to US women’s 9 and 9.5, respectively.  I wound up keeping the 8 (US women’s 9.5), which is a full size larger.  I’ve been wearing them every day for the last 2 weeks, and they have been oh so comfortable.  There was no break in period at all.  \\n\\nAlso, I came from Cloud 5 Combo, which have the speed lacing system.  I really wanted the speed lacing system, but I loved the look of the muted green color with the brown accent and laces.  In these shoes I have them tied just enough so that I’m able to slide my feet in and out just like the Cloud 5 Combo, and they are not loose on my feet at all.  The only downside, and I say this very lightly, is that they make my feet look much wider than they are.  These shoes are a little more substantial than Cloud 5 Combo.  I’m used to it now, but at first I was ready to return them because I didn’t like how they looked.\\n\\nMy first photo shows the Combo 5 on my left foot compared to this one for reference.Hey guys! Just to be clear on the size, It took me forever to figure out what the issue with the sizing was. So many people are saying that they run a whole size too big, that is not true! I finally figured out what the problem is. When you order a size, if it doesn\\'t specify that it is Women\\'s size specifically, then it is listed as a MEN\\'s size! This is why people are buying shoes that are too large, because they are ordering a men\\'s size that they buy as a female size. Mens size is always 1.5 size smaller than a women\\'s number. So for instance if you\\'re a 7 in female size, you are a 5.5 in men. So you would order a 5.5 instead of 7. Then it\\'s a perfect fit. Also helps to translate to European sizes if they are listed. Size 7 women is 37.5 in Superga Euro sizes. So if you see a 7 and it says 38.5 or 39 next to it, then that\\'s a MEN\\'S size 7, not a women\\'s! Hope that helps!How much I wanted to love these! First of all they weigh like 10 pounds a shoe! Second of all the arch was really far back towards the heel and the foot bed is completely flat.I love these! They\\'re very comfortable, despite my very high arches. I\\'m pretty short and always feel like sneakers similar to these (Converse, Keds) make me look stumpy. But, I think the accentuated white sole really does something to make my legs look longer (or maybe it\\'s all in my head)! I love the fabric because it\\'s breathable and super comfy. All in all - a great purchase.I got the Pastel Green and I love them! Super cute and you don\\'t see them everywhere like Converse or Vans. I have narrow feet, so they are a little loose, but I wear them with socks and laced them pretty tight. If I were doing serious athletic activity in these, then I would be bothered by the extra width, but it doesn\\'t matter for just running errands or sightseeing. They are true to size (got my usual 8) and they don\\'t really have arch support. They\\'re fairly flat and maybe a tiny bit heavier than some other plimsolls, but the color and design are so cute that I don\\'t really care about the fit not being perfect.I normally wear a women\\'s 8.5 or 9, although my \"true\" size is an 8 wide. I have a narrow heel, a wide toe box, high arches and high instep. These Cotu Classics fit me perfectly in a 39 with a thinner no-show sock (which is exactly how I plan to wear them). Tried the 39.5 first and liked having more wiggle room with thicker socks, but my heel kept slipping out, even with heel liners. If you have narrow heels like I do, you may need to play around with sock thickness or go down a half size. I had to try a few different socks to get the right feel & look. The eyelets are definitely annoying if you don’t have a sock high enough to cover the top of your foot. I wouldn’t be able to wear these without socks because of the eyelets.\\n\\nSome reviews said the laces aren’t long enough but if you do a barbell style lace, you’ll have more length to tie them with. There are videos online that show you how to do it. \\n\\nSupport feels more firm like a Dansko than squishy running shoes but it works for me. Yes these shoes are a little heavier than foam shoes but I didn’t find it detrimental at all.I have wide feet and an autoimmune disease that causes inflammation, most often, in my feet and legs. I almost always opt for wide or X wide shoes for comfort but have worn many pairs of standard width shoes. My last pair of Hokas wore out (I wore them nearly every day for 2 years though!) and I got these in a wide. I knew as soon as they arrived that they weren\\'t wide at all. I tried wearing them anyway and spent 2 days of work thinking I needed to just break them in. But they hurt SO bad that, by the end of that 2nd day, I was hobbling around. Can\\'t return them cause I wore them so I ended up giving them to my partner. Im sure these are fine if you have narrow feet but if you have anything wider than standard, don\\'t bother.Good, but don\\'t expect it to be a copy of the Rincon 3. Still serviceable as a daily for lighter-gait folks and for speed work. \\n\\nIt fits narrower (like a Mach), and the heel cup is a bit lower and less snug than the 3. Hoka seems to have enhanced the tread durability, though I regularly put 500-600 miles on 3s without serious issues. It also feels like it has more \"pop\" than the 3s, which isn\\'t a bad thing. \\n\\nI love the 3s. They brought me back after a disastrous injury and relapse that kept me off road and trails for nearly two years. I\\'m sad these are a departure from my old faithfuls, but I\\'m not entirely unhappy with the updated shoe overall.I am a woman with wide feet, bunions, etc. I\\'ve been wanting a pair of Hokas due to the cushiony footbed but I knew their women\\'s shoes didn\\'t come in wide widths so I ordered this pair in a men\\'s 7.5 which is supposedly EU 40 2/3 in the widest possible width. I was so surprised at how small they were, barely long enough, tight around the instep, and very difficult to put on. Will return and, sadly, maybe it\\'s time to give up on Hokas for my feet.I officiate  High Varsity Basketball and Football > I purchased a pair of RINCON 4 shoes and I find them to be the most comfortable shoes I worn in a long time. I would appreciate it if you can recommend a shoe to wear on the football field. We officiate football on artifial turf and sometime on natural grass. \\nThank You \\nMarcelino VelasquezI\\'m usually an 11 medium. I\\'m going to have to get a 11.5 in a wide to fit properly with these Hoka\\'s.For my wide feet I found these shoes to tight. I sent them back.They\\'re good, but they run small, about a half size. They feel short and narrow – and I have narrow feet to begin with.Fits true to size. Comfortable. This model is more sturdy than the older 997 models, with a reshaped outsole. I\\'d recommend this to anyone who likes neutral colors.Excellent comfort, cushion, and support for a casual shoe. They are actually the  most comfortable shoe I have ever owned, besides very expensive running shoes. They also fit the same as any other classic New Balance shoe.Shoes have good cushion to them.  They rub a little on my ankles, but a little piece of Moleskin solves the problem.I have a wide toe box and narowish heel and these shoes fit great - I wore them for 8 hours right out of the box with no problems.I\\'m really disappointed because the website said it runs small and to order a half size up, but that wasn\\'t the case, these fit true to size and so the pair I ordered was too big and now my true size is out of stock.My size is a 7 medium. However, this New Balance Classics U574v1 did not conform to my size7 medium. It was too small for my foot.In the spring I bought a pair of 574 shoes that I wore daily for a walking-intensive summer (350 miles, according to my watch). I loved them, but wanted a more universal color. I ordered the pink, which look lovely at first glance… until I put them on. They are significantly shorter and narrower through the toe box than the red pair. I now see that my beloved pair was U574v2 while these are U574v1. There’s no explanation for why they’re different, but they definitely are. I’m debating whether to go for another of the v2 pairs or if I should reorder these a full size larger.I love the way these look but the sneaker is very deep at the heel so the back comes up too high for my foot. Unfortunately, they have to be returned.Perfect for my daughter and here before the first day of school! We love next day free delivery!I ordered a women\\'s 8.5 (mens 6.5) and received a women\\'s 6.5.I’ve ordered these shoes twice and both times I received a smaller size. I checked my order to ensure I selected my correct size and I did but for some reason I keep receiving the men’s size instead of the women’s size that I selected. I am very disappointed because the shoes are really cute but I can’t wear them for the occasion that I purchased them for.Best shoes ever.  I\\'ve been a Hoka guy for a few years but I just don\\'t like their styling.  I switched to ON and these are fantastic.  Just as comfortable but much better style.  Only surprise for me was they are basically slip on shoes as you don\\'t tie them. That actually turned out to be a great thing.  I really love these shoes.Fits true to size. The laces are perfectly snug for a walk or even a jog. You would want to consider running laces for an actual hard run. The support is great through the entire shoe. The heel drop on this shoe compared to the cloudnova is noticeable as you would expect. The shoe is probably one of the best looking On Cloud shoes by far. It actually looks better on foot as opposed to some of the other styles that do not look as you expected.Fit is just slightly large. Cushioning is plush and comfortable. Would love to get the other colors and variants of this model.Quite simply the most comfortable shoe I’ve ever worn. The soles are thick and very lightweight. Like walking on a mattress.These shoes are literally the most comfortable sneakers I’ve ever had on. It’s like walking on pillows. I purchased the cloud 5 and immediately returned them as the soles were not as cushiony. Just ordered another pair of cloud tiltsI have a size 15 of a Skechers slip on (left) and when compared to this size 14 slip-in (right), they are almost identical in size.I have worn Skechers work boots and shoes for a few years and love them, I found that they run small so I always order 1 size bigger, the width has always felt good even though I have a wide foot the med width fits great for me on my work boots and shoes, so thought I would try some slip on for everyday use and was I surprise when I first put them on! They felt like the most comfortable shoe I have ever had fit like a perfect pair of gloves! Very surprise at how light they were, had to look down at them a few time to be sure I was wearing shoes! I have already order another pair different style. Feel well made, look great! Will see how long they last, if the make them as well as their work shoe, they will last for years!These are the BEST sneakers! They are really a good looking shoe, and comfortable from the minute I put them on!! I love the ease of stepping into them, and will never buy a lace up sneaker again!! These are truly amazing shoes!! And to step out of these and step directly into my Sketcher Golf Shoe slip ons is pure heaven!I wear them all the time! this is my second pair. I wear a soze 12 New Balance sneaker but my Skechers are size 11Most comfortable shoe I can ever remember. Very good looking, and I love the Slip-In feature at my 60 years. I bought another pair a couple months ago for my work and decided grab another pair. Very glad I did!very disappointed.  I have been ordering the 990 for many years, always the same size.  This time, the new version 990v6 did not fit well.  too snug at the instep and arch.I\\'m very disappointed in the 990V6. For over 25 years, the New Balance 990 series has been my everyday shoe for casual wear in addition to exercise. I’ve enjoyed the consistent comfort, stability, and foot support this series delivered year after year. Recently I purchased the 990V6 and am very disappointed. It appears that New Balance has greatly cheapened the quality of this model. A couple of examples compared to the 990V5: The 990V does not have as much suede around the ankle or the heel. New Balance also removed the plastic ankle supports on 990V6.  Based on those two changes, the 990V6 does not support my ankle nearly as well as previous models. I would have been ok paying more to make sure I can continue to buy a high-quality shoe. Instead, I believe New Balance will realize these cost-cutting measures will cause loyal 990V customers to find another brand.Two months into this shoe and am bummed.  V6 is a stylish look compared to earlier versions, but New Balance missed the mark by making the upper too small to allow orthotics to fit comfortably.  Need a shoe horn to jam my foot in unlike any earlier versions.  Also, they have soles with grids that perfectly capture sand particles that assures you will track that into the house.  New Balance, wake up or lose your last American made shoe…Overall, best sneaker out there. I’m an 11.5, I have a little wiggle room. NB suggests going down half a size - that’s a bit risky. I wear them to the gym, on hikes, long walks and jogging. They have become my go to sneaker. According to my kids the black pair is “fire”. Guess that’s a good thing.My husband has been wearing New Balance 990 forever.   Zappos usually has his size and width (which is often hard to find) in stock. They fit him perfectly and he is delighted that he now has a new pair.  I don\\'t bother to look elsewhere for his shoes - I go straight to Zappos.When I first tried them on, I noticed that the leather inside the shoe just inside the mouth pinched the skin around my tendons. It stung for a couple of days. Now, I don\\'t know if I developed callouses quickly or the leather just became soft, but all I know is that the pain went way. This is a mighty fine shoe. I just wanted to point out that minor flaw.This shoe was a requested gift. Have been wearing Vans for a long time. Great classic shoe, comfortable. Like the understated black on black.I purchased these for work and had bought Vans previously for the same purpose. I am a long time fan of Vans products. That being said, this pair of shoes had several holes in them withing 3.5 months of getting them. Work shoes usually last me 12-16 months and my work habits have not changed at all. I was disappointed in the quality of the productLove my vans they are so comfortableThese shoes have gotten me quite a few comments and looks from people. They have that classic cool factor, they feel comfortable for the most part, and seemed to have more cushioning than the Converse I tried before.These feel really supportive and stable. I recently hurt an ankle and these are really helpful and comfortable. I may be getting more if they have a sale inOh my God I love this shoe it\\'s so comfortable support my ankle I wish they came in more colors overall excellent and I was shop with on cloud again!!!Pretty disappointed in these shoes and would not recommend. I have two on pairs on Ons and these feel significantly cheaper and less comfortable. Materials used on these shoes do not feel very nice and the soul/footbed is extremely hard. Also, there was almost no arch support and the footbed felt completely flat and hard. \\n\\nThey looks great though so depends on what you are looking for I guess.Very happy with these shoes.  Not only do they look great, they are incredibly comfortable.  I am glad I bought them!These actually aren\\'t longer or wider than normal but they have a greater volume than average so they feel as if they are bigger than they are. If you typically wear thicker socks, it\\'s probably fine. If you wear thinner socks, you may want to size down half a size. The bigger issue is that they are extremely firm. They look like they would be soft step in and wearing but compared to any modern NB or Nike or Asics they feel hard on your foot.A very nice shoe, but it doesn’t have a removable inner sole so my orthotic can’t be placed under it. Also, the inner sole is firm and unlike the cloud ON shoes I’ve purchasedThey’re great! Very comfy.Out of the box they did not fit well but I\\'ve had Vans in the past so to be expected. \\nI put them in the microwave (yes, microwave) for about 30secs and put them on and walked around the house till they cooled... Wa lah... instant break in and fit like a glove now...Awesome shoe... narrow fit- \\nThese retro Vans are amazingly cool. I get a ton of compliments when I wear them. The only problem is that they are very narrow. I have (I THINK) a normal foot. These shoes cut in on the sides of my feet near the toes. I wear them anyway, of course, because they are so downright rad. They stretch out a bit after wearing them for a while and it\\'s enjoyable to wear them without socks in the summer. COOL COLORS, TOO!!These are the classic vans slip shoes. I got my first pair in 1984 when I was 5! They\\'re great shoes for walking, skateboarding, and going out! All around vans shoes are a great all around shoe! And I just want to say how much Zappos rocks!! I have been getting all my shoes from them for the fast 4 years! I have never been let down a single time!This review is specifically for the Perforated suede (I bought the cloud color). I have the perf leather in black and those have held up amazingly, but the perf suede, because the material is so soft and pliable, a tear has formed on the inner side of the toe box, where your foot flexes most. I was surprised by this, but after reading more reviews of the suede material Vans, this is quite common, but still annoying. Zappos, because they have amazing customer service, refunded my money, but they were sold out in my size and color of the perf suede vans and so I couldn’t replace these shoes and I really liked the like creamy color of the shoes. Just beware when buying the suede vans!!LOVE! These are my eight pair of vans and these are so stylish. I especially love the slip on because they are so convenient.I wanted a shoe that somewhat looked like my Chuck T\\'s because I started noticing everyone jumping on the Chuck T bandwagon. At first they were just an acceptable replacement, but now I think they look better with most jeans and shorts than the Chuck T\\'s. I can wear them with socks or without socks and be comfortable. That being said, the worst part was the break-in period, which lasted over a month. The upper heel support is leather or synthetic leather, either way it is REALLY tacky. This ate away at my heel for quite awhile. I like to wear no-show socks and those were not high enough to stop the back of my ankle from getting chewed up. I started walking on the backs to make it loosen up a bit. I even contemplated putting some sort of fabric tape back there, or cutting out the leather part. But I toughed it out, and after about 1.5 months it eventually stopped being so tacky and now the shoe is perfect.These are the shoes I have been searching for my entire life. Little did I know they were right under my nose. I`d always seen them and passed them up. The older I get, the lazier I get. No laces?! Sign me up! These are comfy. I have slightly wide feet and these really fit the bill in terms of not being too squished for my poor little feet. They are cute, go with everything, and are great every day shoe. No complaints thus far. I will continue to repurchase when these die.Herk Engineer. \\nI got my first pair of checkerboard Vans in the late 1970\\'s when I was in high school in Southern California, (Artesia High). They were cool then and they\\'re still cool today. Since then I\\'ve been flying for the Air Force for 16 years here in Arkansas. I got a pair for Christmas last year and I was surprised they still existed. I\\'m 41 now and I get so many compliments when I,m sporting my Vans. Everyones body grows older, but you\\'re spirit doesn\\'t have to,(I still skate the half pipe). For style, comfort, fit, and especially personality, you can\\'t beat the \"Classic Slip-On.Perfect shoe for my art!Love these. I was getting kind of bored/annoyed with my Converse lately (the tongue is all wrinkly), so when my friend got these in white and I tried them on I was inspired. I got these in black and white and they are really cute! At first I worried that they might be stiff for a while but after slipping them on and off to try them on about 5 times and wearing them for 1 school day, they\\'ve loosened up and fit perfectly! They make my feet look smaller than they are (yay) which I like about Vans, because Converse tend to do the opposite. Zappos service was great as usual. One thing, though -- these seem to run large, and I typically wear a women\\'s 7 and my friend\\'s 6 fit me. I ended up getting a 6.5, however, and they are perfect, so go a half-size down than your usual size. Thanks Zappos!Bought these for a Europe summer vacation.  Only wore them once before going on vacation and they were instantly comfortable, no break in period necessary. Completely stylish, can dress up or down, and walked 7-14 miles per day for three weeks in these.I am 10.5 or 11 shoe size - the On the Roger fit perfectly at size 10.5Amazing shoes for everyday walking and for nice events! A great pair of shoes for everything!These are super comfortable and stylish. Unlike other shoes by this brand, this is NOT an exercise shoe. I wear the Clouds for everyday wear and the Cloudswifts for running. I wear these shoes casually, and they can easily be dressed up or down. HIGHLY recommend!Super comfortable and light weight.Zappos is truly amazing. I received these in one day and found them to be slightly large, I needed a pair for the weekend and contacted their customer service and they immediately placed a new order for me which I received the next day!! Amazing!!! For reference I am a 6.5 in the regular old skools and the 6 in the platforms fits me perfectly.LOVE these and they\\'re my first pair of Vans!  Walked for 3 long days all over Manhattan in June and they were super comfortable and cute.  \\n\\nAdmittedly part of my comfort system were Thorlo brand tennis ankle socks which I bought in black so they disappear into the all black Vans shoe.  My feet could breathe all day long despite the miles of concrete and museums. \\n\\nHappy to report they didn\\'t need any breaking in either. I had gone on a couple of 3-4 mile walks close to home before our trip to make sure but all was well from the very first time. \\n\\nSo happy to add these to my walking shoe wardrobe!I love these shoes ??My shoe collection is huge but these are in my top favorites. Very trendy right now and I’m looking forward to wearing them all year. Super comfortable, a little tight to put your foot in initially because the laces are difficult to loosen, but no problems once they’re on. Definitely recommendI love these shoes because \\n1. Price was unbeatable;\\n2. Comfort and fit were perfect;\\n3. They were on my front porch the next day, and\\n4. No one else has a pair of Vans like me!Been searching for an everyday shoe that provides support for walking and normal wear, and goes with a lot of outfits. This one is the winner! It reminds me of the running shoes I wore in the early aughts. Supportive, nice cushion, comfortable on my aging feet, which need more love these days. I go between 6.5 and 7 in women’s and ordered both to compare, as several reviews said they run large. I didn’t experience this, and the 7 (my usual running shoe size) fit the best, with the slight wiggle room I need (and ability to wear thicker socks if need be). If you’re on the fence I say go for it! It’s a reliable brand and good value for a shoe like this.I don\\'t wear shoes that bend in half. So I returned them.Typically wear an 8 in sneakers but took a 7.5 in these. Super comfortable and lightweight.Bought these for my daughter for school and she loves them so far. Says they have great support and are comfortable out of the box.Bellos , son true size , el color la calidad son preciosos combinan con cualquier ropa lo compre para mi hermana y le facinaronThe classic that never dies! Chucks, despite the common misconception, are indeed true to size. I don\\'t understand the fuss over the \"size down\" trend here. As a simplistic canvas and rubber shoe, they are not going to snug like modern sneakers. It is no surprise that so many reviewers say to size down but also say their shoes are narrow. Buy your true size and Chucks are not narrow. Comfortable too - Pete Maravich didn\\'t need arch support, neither do you!Great shoes. I\\'m in a wheelchair, so the rubber helps keep my feet on the footrest. I guess they\\'re comfortable? I really can\\'t feel them. I order them a size larger than other things I wear, so an 8 women\\'s, so I would recommend you go larger with these. They look good with anything I wear, and I get compliments every now and then, as well!I have worn converse for years. This is the first time I have had s pair fall apart. To say the least I am not happy.First of all Zappos is awesome! I ordered these shoes one day and was wearing them the next! Love these shoes, I\\'ve been wearing them for years. I will never buy shoes from anyone else ever again.I bought these to just have a more casual pair of sneakers around. I put off getting them for years because the stores only carried full sizes, but when I heard they came in half sizes too I ordered a pair. I\\'m a Women\\'s size 6.5 usually, and I tried on a size 6 in a local store to get a sense of the sizing, but that was too big and ultimately ordered a 5.5 which fit fine.\\n\\nI noticed in putting them on for the first time that they have basically no support, but I put a pair of arch supports in them and they\\'re good to go.Bought them on 4/29. Only lasted a few months and blew out the front toe.  Not good for walking miles and miles everyday at work.First time client of On. I ordered two new pairs of running/walking shoes. My previous Adidas have lost their bounce after a year of almost daily walks. First I tried on my tried and true favorite ASICS #28 and boy I was happy in them walking around the house on the “test run”. Then, I tried on the On brand. I noticed immediately as I was taking them out from the box they we moon weight light! I immediately fell into them. They are for me and I am sold. The sole is firm (fitting my need) the comfort was as if I was barefoot and the style is good for me, not flashy not boring. Thanks ON I’m with you :)This is a perfectly-fitting and comfortable shoe. I’ve been wearing them daily for 2 weeks now and my feet feel great! I think the sole looks a bit weird, but if it helps make the shoe as comfortable as it is, then it’s fine with me.True to size. Very comfortable and stylish.LOVE IT! \\nSofter and feels lighter than the old version.Let\\'s be honest - you know what\\'s up if you\\'re ordering a fresh pair of Chucks. Styles and fads come and go, Chucks are everlasting. I\\'m 28 and will undoubtedly own dozens more in my remaining years. These particular pair arrived just as advertised. Color is slightly off-white with a cool yellow tinge. Do I recommend? Frickin \\'a. Just keep livin\\', friends. Just keep livin\\' in these awesome pair of Chuck Taylor\\'s.Not the same as they were--\\n\\n\\nMy husband is 55, and he\\'s been wearing them since he was 30. He stopped wearing them for the past five years or so because he had a job with a more formal environment, but he switched jobs recently to a more casual environment, and he was so happy to be able to wear chucks again, so he put on his old pair and wore them for about six months. Then, they wore out.\\n\\nHe ordered his usual size 13, and it was too big--then he ordered a size smaller, and it was too small. The biggest difference now is that the top topper that used to be rubber is plastic now and it just doesn\\'t have the flex. Then he tried a 12 on at the store. That fix, but still wasn\\'t comfortable. He switched to VANs. Just not the same, either in manufacturing or in quality control.I love these shoes but I\\'ll probably end up putting in-soles because I have high arches. It\\'s amazing how incredibly fast the order came though. My shoe size can range from a woman\\'s 6, 6.5, or 7 depending on the brand. I bought a woman\\'s size 6.5 Converse Chuck Taylor All Star Hi-top and it fits perfectly. I\\'ll definitely be shopping at Zappos more!They are much larger than a normal women\\'s size. My daughter normally wears a women\\'s size 10, but with these, she wears an 8 to 8 1/2.super cute and fit a little big'"
